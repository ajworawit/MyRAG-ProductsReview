Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I love the material. Its so soft and the color is just as the picture . of coarse my husband didn't like it but its really cool and it works great with out room decor!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"OMG, so easy to put together. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the bottom on top. The plastic parts are also hard to put together."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Notice the wood handle is previously fitted then separated from its own utensil. Align each handle back into its own utensil and pound it in to wedge it. Season the handle several times with wood or mineral oil. Perfect.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"We use these on multi-sizes of mason jars for our 7 year old (larger jar) and our 4 year old (smaller jar) and they work perfectly. Although not entirely spill proof which is why I only gave it 4 stars, the kids are neat enough to not create spills. I could see that being a problem for other kids however. Even with that, I would buy again and recommend as a good purchase for anyone looking for drinking covers for mason jars, which for us is our favorite cup for the kids. We haven't really used the straws but I do like them and they are durable to last a while. When we use them I will update this review."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,The stand is perfect for raising the TV enough to be able to place the Blue-Ray player underneath.  The setup looks nicely organized and neat.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This is my first Super Tinker after using up 2 Tinkers and a couple of others. I'm a mechanic and general tinkerer and very hard on knives. The standard Tinker is nice and light and thin, but I found myself missing the scissors and went for this after finally destroying my last Tinker (abuse - my fault). The Super is not much larger than the Tinker, but I wouldn't keep either loose in my pocket for long. I find hanging them in my pocket from a key ring/belt clip saves my clothing and makes it harder to lose the knife.
  These knives are incredibly useful as a mini tool kit. I use the screwdrivers constantly, the awl makes a great drill, and the blades hold an edge pretty well. I often use the tweezers for removing splinters and deer ticks. It takes a substantial amount of force to break these knives (I figured out how much). So far I haven't used the scissors very often, but they are well made and work well.
  The toothpick is rather goofy, but I guess it's traditional to have one. The parcel hook has been useless so far, and I'd have preferred a file or something else. That said, I can't imagine not carrying a Swiss Army knife, and it's sad to have to leave it home sometimes because of increased security screening in some locations. Such is modern life."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,CG,"I had a lot of time to research the materials and I chose this one for the price. It is so bright and the light is so small that it is easy to take it off the shelf and into the kitchen.

I was also very impressed with the excellent product and the quality of the finish.

I did have a problem with the opening on the back of the blade, but I had to use a different blade to get it to open.

The quality of the finish is superb, and the finish is absolutely gorgeous.

I highly recommend this blade to anyone looking for a quality blade for a reasonable price.

I have not used it on a workbench yet, but I do plan to. It is bright and bright for an afternoon or evening. It has a good grip, but I have no doubt it will last.

I would recommend this knife to anyone looking for a quality blade for a reasonable price.

The blade is of a very solid design and it is well constructed. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a quality blade for a reasonable price.I purchased two of these for my RV and I loved them so much I bought 2 more for my son's room.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"These scrapers are really strong.  They are lightweight and comfortable.  I also like the fact that they do not have the dimmer feature.  The light output is excellent.  The motion sensor is well built and works well.  The size is perfect and is perfect for hanging items.  The 2 AAA batteries are the most convenient.  The directions are clear and easy to follow.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for an inexpensive, compact flashlight that can be used for everyday tasks.

The other features I have found are the motion sensor, which is just a little larger than the other lights.  When you push it on, it turns on automatically.  The motion sensor turns on and off automatically.  I can also hold the light in my hands and it will turn on and off automatically.  I have used the motion sensor a few times and it is still"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"High quality with very nice features. Having the ability to pause the water stream or stop it just by touching the spout or handle comes in handy whether you are washing your hands or doing dishes. You can save money with this feature. The faucet looks very good with nice styling. It comes with PEX hoses and very easy connection features. The faucet is designed for 4"" to 18"" spread between the handle and spout, but I do not recall that being specified in the advertisements. Our large single bowl sink caused the two to be mounted at opposite sides at the rear of the sink--20"" apart center to center. I soon discovered that the spout grounding wire and the LED spout indicator cable would not reach that distance. The grounding wire is a single conductor so it was easy enough to splice and solder some additional wire to span the distance. The LED cable is a three conductor cable with a jack and receptacle connection. To span the extra distance I purchased an extension cable from Radio Shack--designed for use with stereo connections/computer connections etc. The faucet works well, simply and effectively. No leaks."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,easy to use but not a real pain.  I've also used this for a few hours.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Having a drill around the house, I thought it would be a nice addition to the tool box.

I had a lot of trouble with the drill itself, so I decided to give it a try. It worked great, and was easy to install.

The drill does not have a 2-piece screw driver. I have had to use a second set of hex-driver bits to get the screwdriver to work properly. The hexdriver bit is well made, and looks great.

The drill is very sturdy, and the handle is very well built.

Overall, it's a well-made tool box, and I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a tool box to carry around.I bought these to replace my old faucets and they are great!  I have used them for almost a month now and they are well made and have a very good feel to them.  I have used them for many different projects and I am very happy with them.  I have used them for everything from lighting to painting to window lighting.  I have used them for very small projects, I have also used them for framing.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for a quick fix for a small project.  I would recommend these to anyone that needs to replace a faucet that has been fauceted for a while.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,I'm just getting into mobile/tablet/small electronics repair and slowly gathering tools as I learn. I have a load of plastic spudgers/pry tools and already have seen how the plastic ones survive only for a job or two. These feel nice and durable. Very inexpensive too. I feel like these will last a long time as long they aren't abused.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,These were great. I just had to order a longer size.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,These are great. Simple and effective. Great value for the money.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I have 4 of these in my bathroom and they look great. I use them for very heavy items ranging from oversize wet bath towels to kids bath toys. They fit in the decor really well without having to go and install unsightly bath hooks that require drilling into the wall. They are the perfect size for what I need and very easy to install. I haven't had to remove them yet, however they are stuck to tile so I'm not sure how the removable feature works but so far they have held up in the humidity of my bathroom very well. I would recommend these to my friends and family who might be looking for great hooks that hold up very well.

I received this item for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,This set of blades was easy to install and worked perfect. The piece that holds the blades is actually an upgrade from what came with my original Makita hand planer.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"DO NOT buy a Streamlight because you think there's a lifetime warranty, there really isn't. You have to read the fine print.

I bought and received a genuine Streamlight Microstream (NOT an imported knock-off), and have loved it while it worked. The problem I have with the company is their misleading use of the term ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"". Let me explain. Streamlight's ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"" doesn't apply to electronics, bulbs, batteries, or switches, just to what they deem as manufacturer's defects. So, basically, their so-called warranty applies only to manufacturing defects in the aluminum body-tube of the light. NOT COOL, Streamlight... you want us to ""Buy American"", but you have a crappily designed switch that wreaks of designed obsolescence.

Cost of a replacement tail cap/switch is $12 ($4 + $8 shipping), which is hardly worth it, especially considering that the LED emitter has been upgraded from 35 to 45 lumens."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,Package arrived on time and the product came rolled up in a box. It has a strong lavender smell to it / chemical smell to it which I think will go away after 48 hours of waiting. I like the patterns that are engraved on the top of the foam it adds extras to it.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Working great for over a week.  My installation is a bit different.  I am using it to activate a WEMO switch to turn on 100+ feet of LED cafe lights outside.  I have these in weather proof/resistant enclosures and have good outside WIFI due to an access point I have outside.  I had to drill a 1/2"" hole in the enclosure for the motion sensor to work.  It can not sense anything through plastic or glass.  A plastic bag was successful during testing, but not how I wanted to install it.  For additional weather proofing, I used silicon on areas prone to water intrusion.  To link the sensor to the WEMO switch, I just used IFTT(If this then that website)  and a simple rule mated them well.(If motion detected, then turn on wemo)

Works super.  Turns on lights as desired and sends IFTT alerts as well(though this is hit or miss it seems).

Also, this set up is working with Alexa(amazon echo) so I can say, ""Alexa, turn off cafe lights"" and she goes to work.

As a WIFI sensing device, I suppose the price is as expected, though I feel its more of a 20 something dollar device."

This isn't a deal breaker for me, but be forewarned, they seem to be made out of aluminum that is only slightly thicker than a disposable casserole pan (that can be purchased from the grocery store).

Sense I bought these strictly for functionality, and not for their aesthetic appeal; and, being that they were $6.40 each, I am pleased with my purchase and will be keeping them.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"This could potentially be an outstanding tool, but for a few unfortunate short-cuts and oversights.
Short-cut: detachable legs, designed no doubt to ship in a smaller box and possibly save manufacture expense.  My saw rocks back and forth across two opposite corners because my legs are not straight.  An accurately cast one-piece base would solve this.
Short-cut: cheesy plastic clamps that are awkward to use because the holes in the clamping tensioner through which the clamp rods pass do not align easily, and because in the angle-clamp mode the second part of the tensioner assembly that allows use at an angle does not attach to the main tensioner, but rather aligns loosely, requiring something of a juggling act to assemble the three items for angle-use.
Oversight: the clamp is not usable in its normal configuration (through the back, in the v-slot on the bed) for thinner narrow stock laid flat to miter cut because the clamping foot won't rotate far enough down.
Short-cut: mysteriously, the manufacturer takes the time to give a tutorial on geometry required to lay out angles for frames/boxes that are regular polygons, and even gives tips on saw usage, but provides crappy wordless diagrams for most of the assembly of the tool (which is not totally intuitive and takes a little keen observation to pull off.)  Annoying.

The sockets sit in kinda of a shallow valley when in the case, each has their place but if you are jar the case they can fall out of the case kinda easy.  Also the hinge of the case is a living hinge, meaning the hinge is just really bending plastic back and forth, without a hinge like a door hinge so to speak it really makes the case very suspect-able to wearing out as you bend the plastic to open the case and then have to bend the plastic back to the closing position. The sockets are great, the customer service associated with the TEXTON tool brand is excellent, but the case itself could have better design for longevity and sockets keeping where they should stay as you move the case with the door in the open position.  But for the price you really can't get a more better set for the price."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"I've never made homemade butter, but I thought it would be a nice addition to the kitchen.  It's not.  I am using it in the microwave, so it is microwaved.  It's not in the oven, so it's not really an option.  I also love the fact that it is the perfect size for the kitchen table.  I've had it for about a year now and I love the fact that it's so easy to clean and dry.  I have had it for a few months now, and I'm not sure how long it will last.  The color is beautiful, and the texture is not too soft.  It's a very good size for my purposes. "

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,CG,"Was looking for a small, portable, and very comfortable flashlight.  This is the one.  It's bright enough to see your way and is light enough to cover a lot of ground.  It's not a high-quality flashlight.  This one is still very bright.  It's a great flashlight.  I've had it for a while now and will definitely buy it again.  This one is a little bigger than my previous one and a little more bulky.  I have to say that I'm very pleased with it.  I haven't had it in a while but it's a nice flashlight. "
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,really nice quality drop cloths. I'm using mine as a removable side for the pergola. I love it.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Excellent adapter for my recess light. Despite the instruction from the seller about removing the ballast and same from many users, I did not remove the ballast in my recess can (don't know if it even has it). And it worked fine just plug and play. I did check the voltage on the terminals of my recess can which has the gx23 connector and it was 120v to confirm that the LED would work ok. I guess the ballast removal is required for some old CFL light, but if you can confirm 120v is the voltage out of your gx23 before plugging this adapter in then no need to worry about it.
Update: given that so many said about bypassing the ballast, I just did an experiment. I have 3 recess lights in the kitchen having the gx23 plug. I reopened one and bypassed the ballast. It's kind of pain doing that. The black (hot) wires are hard connected to the ballast (one in one out), so bypassing means cutting them off and reconnect. Note that to see the ballast, you need to unscrew a side screw in the recess can and then lower the top plate which has the gx23 mounted on it. you will see the ballast which is a little silver box attached to it. I only did the bypass for one of three lights just to see if anything changes. Now turned on the lights and I could not notice any difference! No humming noise from the ones with the ballast (not bypassed) either."

The only downside is"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"My primary use for this toolbox is to keep inside of my truck.

I bought this product to replace my 19"" steel tool box that was your basic, tray ontop and storage below.  I never used a cantilever box before but i thought i could make good use of its space to keep my tools organized.

This toolbox really let me organize a lot more that i thought it would. I put all my ""everyday"" tools in the top 2 compartments. 1 side has a variety of screwdrivers and utility knives and the other side has adjustable wrenches, pliars and ratchets. In the middle compartments I used for my ""Special"" tools, 1 side has alan keys, tin snips, and the other side has my star screwdriver set and extra star bits. In the bottom compartment i have all my racthet sockets, a grease gun, a tool wrap with wrenches and a plastic storage box with bolts/screw/nuts.

The construction of the box is great, the paint job is profession grade. Smooth operation for opening and closing.

With the box closed (handles together) you can access the 2 top compartments just by flicking them open, really nice feature. You can also put a simple clip to keep them from opening on their own, or even a small lock if you'd like.

The item was shipped in its own manufacturer's box inside of another standard brown box.

I highly suggest this box to anyone that has tools and wants to keep them organized in one spot. There is a lot of room in this box and they made it the right size for things like long sockets to stand up next to eahother insted of stacking them ontop of eachother. I can look in my box and see exactly what i need and where it is. No more moving stuff around to get at the tool that I need.

I plan on looking into more of excel's products."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"Smelled bad, very bad the first few days. Rotting grass small.

It had good support first few days. But then the support fizzled and the pillow turned into a pancake.

Not worth the price."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I've had this filled with a mix of chocolate and nuts for about a month now. I keep it stored in the refrigerator and so far we've used it to grate nuts and chocolate over ice cream as a topping, sprinkled over oatmeal, added to brownie batter before baking, and  it has even been used to grate pecans directly onto pancakes.

This mill comes with two different size blades. The smaller blade grates very small, the nuts come out looking like a nut meal. I prefer the larger size blade, nuts and chocolate come out with a nicer texture. The extra blade can be stored inside of the cap, which is a very nice feature.

I like the viewing windows on the side, you can see at a glance if you need to refill. I learned not  fill it too full, if filled too full screwing the cap back on can become a bit of a challenge. This mill seems to work better when it is lightly filled anyways, especially if you have a mix of different items inside so you can get a better mix when you turn the mill.

Just turn the mill like you would a pepper grinder and the grated nuts, cheese, or chocolate come out the bottom. There is a small cap that fits over the bottom that helps keep everything fresh and also helps keep any stray crumbs contained. This is very easy to use and helps make baked goods look a tiny bit fancier. This mill is a useful little kitchen gadget that I find myself using much more than I thought I would.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,This is an additional vacuum for my Festool tools.  it is already being use with the Domino and the saw.  Works like a charm.  Packaging was good.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These are great!  Strong, multiple sizes, very high quality.  I have bought cheap-o brands that break easily.  These seem pretty much unbreakable.  Excellent product."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"I have my chains sharpened professionally when they begin to cut crooked due to uneven wear.  Otherwise, I touch them myself as soon as they fail to cut uniform shavings.  This usually occurs after about an hour of cutting hardwoods or two hours of softwoods.  If the bar gets into the dirt or you hit a nail you will be sharpening even sooner.  You can either carry several chains to get you through the day or be prepared to touch them up on the bar.

I prefer to touch up my own chains because the saw shops usually take off about 2MM of steel when they sharpen.  At that rate, a chain does not last very long.  If you touch up your own chains when they first begin to dull, you will only take off a few thousandths of an inch.

This tool works well if you gauge the grinder off of the tooth as described in some of the other posts.  The problem is powering the grinder while in the field.  Cordless grinders don't hold a charge very long so you need to carry extra batteries.  Corded grinders need a place to be plugged in.  Either solution limits you mobility.

I prefer the ""Oregon"" brand file and gauge.  No electricity required and it easily goes in your thigh pocket or field kit.  Only one or two strokes per tooth needed for a touch-up and you are back to work.  The gauge make it easy for even a neophyte to maintain proper tooth shape and depth."

I do not have the dolley, but I keep these around and in vehicles to hold tools an items that I don't want just sitting around loosely when being transported and I know what boxes contain different items so I can more conveniently move them around and stack them for organization. I need more of these, but I do think they are a bit pricey for being cases. A caution when stacking is that they aren't super secure when just clipped together.

I was not required to write a positive review and I do not rate products higher than they should have been. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's requirements.

I recently received a Survival Bracelet Kit by Sahara Sailor for a product review.

The kit itself looked very nice with the orange/grey paracord, but I will admit I hated to take it apart because I figured I couldn't put it back together.  However, I got this for a product review so I proceeded to take it apart.

I paid attention to the steps I took, even taking pictures, and slowly took the kit apart.  I dumped out the contents, and everything seemed to be there - a pretty neat little kit of various items.  The flashlight has a piece of plastic on the battery, once you remove that it works fine.

To my own surprised, I was actually able to put the full kit together - it didn't look as nice as it did when I got it, but still looked pretty good.  Overall this is a neat little kit that would be a great novelty gift, and could actually come in handy depending on the person.  Since you can put it back together, you could swap the contents for whatever you felt was useful.

Bottom line: Nice little kit, and if you are careful you can put it back together."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I usually use Nescafe instant decaf coffee, but sometimes I just want that brewed taste.  This little coffeemaker works with coffee pods, not K-cups.  I find that for MY taste, using 2 pods is better than 1.  I usually use a 12 to 14 ounce mug though, so that stands to reason.  I always use filtered water, and I use the pod holder per the instructions - one pod beneath and one pod above the divider.  It takes slightly longer to brew than heating the same amount of water in the microwave, but it's a little nicer result.

The only complaint I have at this point is that it's not tall enough to hold my FAVORITE coffee mug, but I get around that by using something else.

I wish there were more choices in decaf coffee pods, but that is not the fault of the brewer!

After I brew a cup, I put a small dish in the coffee cup holder to catch any drips, and leave the lid to the water reservoir up, so that it can air out and dry itself."

Many LED lamps have a reddish cast to them, but this one has the proper mix of color that avoids that. Output-wise, The 3 levels of light are comparable to other bulbs and of course the much lower energy requirement lets you leave this on without worry. It's pretty much instant-on, with the tiny delay which is an LED norm - they have electronics so the bulbs are really ""powering up"" when you turn them on. It's negligible but deserves mention if you haven't used LED bulbs yet.

I have used them in his bathroom and bathroom sink to get the water flowing and he loves them. I also like the color and the way they look. I had a few of these installed in my home and they look great. I have a few other"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,Good buy for the price. I love the look and feel of this lamp. I just ordered a pair of the dimmable ones. The light output is excellent. The motion sensor is well built and works well.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,horrible. bought for a rental ended up not even using them. you cant screw them tight enough to stay on the handle will twist off in your hand from the outside.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Haven't used this yet but it looks like it will come in handy. Unfortunately, I bought it right
after we replaced the slings on a couple sling chairs. It would have been really nice to
have the dremel and this attachment handy when trying to get to some bolts. It appears
well made and should last for many years."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is so great! It's tall and pretty big though so beware, and make sure to measure before you buy it! I definitely recommend for anyone who needs somewhere to dry those hand washed dishes."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Okay... let me start by saying that I have never used this apple corer on apples. I used it on potatoes to make a recipe called potatoe bombs (stuffed baked potatoes). This little device worked great in coring the potatoes and I imagine it would do a great job on coring an apple too. My recipe turned out great and this corer worked very well, helping cut down on prep time."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I like to have air circulating in the room while I sleep but don't like it blowing directly on me like my ceiling fan does.  with this I can aim it in any direction and still get the airflow with our it directly blowing on me.  I have had this fan for 2 months now and use it every night, it seems to be well built and is a nice design."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,Great concept. Hope not to need it but takes little space to store it. Good piece of mind. Recommended it to friends too.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Love this blanket, wish I had bought it years ago. I will keep it for a long time.I bought this for a friend, she loves it!I bought this"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,I used this on an old house and it worked fine. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the small size of the handle. The handle is so small that it's difficult to grip it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"These mitts are great! They are a nice quality and they fit nicely on my table!Very pretty.I bought this for a friend, and she is very pleased with the quality.  The color is beautiful and the material is very thin.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great stainless steel dishwasher.  I also love the fact that it is a non-stick surface, and that it can be washed with soap and water.  I will buy more for her kitchen!I bought this for a friend, she loves it, she loves it, she just loves it. She makes a lot of pasta and doesn't have to worry about it"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"ok this unit arrived about 2 days after I ordered it,  it was packaged very well,  I was wanting the stainless steel version because I thought it would hold up much better,  after I read a few things on the net I discovered that Copper actually dissipates heat better than stainless,  so I got this AFTER I read copper has gone up about 40 percent lately and I didn't want to wait any longer.  So far I soaked it in a vinegar solution  with water to get all the goo off of it and plopped it down in the keg with boiling wart,  this sanitized it,  the wort was cooled to about 70 within 9 minutes this may be because I have well water and its very cold.  If you are wanting to make beer on a regular basis and you have a large brew pot just get the 50 ft version,  its only about 20 dollars more (at this time) and it will cool your wart that much faster and you can brew 5 gallons or 10 gallons.

bottom line copper is getting freaking expensive,  if you are going to get a wort chiller made of copper get it soon and get the most you can afford, don't wait today is march 4 and oil was at 105 so its just going to get more expensive and you can make cheep beer,  so it will pay for its self the sooner you buy it and use it.

as they say in the brew community, ""Cheers!"""
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,this arrived quickly.  packed well.  exactly what i needed @ a great price.  highly recommend.  would buy this item again.  the best steamer insert i have ever bought.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Its really decent at removing paint and rust. Wears out of course, but for small jobs where you have rusted metal... great. I found that on my metal gate, that even the tiniest rust marks showing on the paint uncovered AN INCH RADIUS OF RUST. This is where this tool really excels... it helps kick off the flake, then you just keep grinding until you find a clean primer/paint and metal interface without dark rust. Try to apply even pressure though its ez to offset it and then you have a jumpy drill."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"This protractor has been a very good tool for reading and setting up angles.  The readout is a little off, so instead of reading the degrees, then setting the same angle on my miter saw, I use the protractor to physically set the angle of the saw blade.  The Starrett protractor is well built and is easy to use (other  than the problem noted above)."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"My wife thinks I'm stupid because I have several flashlights that have multiple modes and whenever you turn them on it is usually in the wrong mode.  Do you really think that you need a flashlight with a strobe?  I bought her this simple on off light and she loves it.  Truth be told, it does make a lot more sense than a five mode tactical light.  Came with a good battery and a charger."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Came fast I think I ordered it early in the week and it was here by the end. I ordered mine with the 100g weight for recalibration. I feel for the price I paid this thing is great and with the test/recalibration weight even better I also like how it has all the instruction right on the lid. I have owned others and the where about the same, I've used it from everything from rocks, herb, mail, and anything else I might have needed it for. What I was looking for the money."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,Not crazy about these. This is my second set. The first ones looked like a film was forming on the glass. I had them for quite a while so I didn't return them. Purchased the second set and they did the same thing. I have this pattern in the dishes and wanted plastic glasses because of them being in a motorhome.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"I got it because it has a magnetic end. Which is strong and holds on to the piece of metal that you want to hang on the wall. Well built and withstands drops from a couple of feet.

Would i buy it again? yes... but i would buy the same generic china made one that is exactly the same at half the price.

Edit: middle bubble it doesn't really give an accurate reading. Half of the liquid is gone :/ kinda worthless just to use the level vertically only."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Wow, what a great little flashlight that packs a punch.  This thing is way brighter than my LED flashlight with 4 LED's and I love the adjustable spotlight.  It puts out a nice big round spotlight depending how near or far you are."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Sturdy, durable... Not as good as the Bosch version but it's still a very nice product.I bought this to replace the Schlage 32-60-8 bulb that I replaced with this one.  It works great, but it is very thin and doesn't hold up very well.  It is a bit dimmer than the Schlage version, but I've had it for about a year now and I like the idea of having a ""taste"" of the bulb.  I've also had other lamps that have a dimmer that is not as dim as this one and it makes it more of a ""taste"" of the bulb.  It is a bit dimmer than the Schlage version but I've had it"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,Perfect quality and length for what it is.  Not too large or too small for my desk.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"I ordered 2 - one for me, one for a gift. I am extremely disappointed. The do NOT operate within the range described. Both have trouble functioning with in a 16' range. I got this to replace an older unit which still works perfectly up to 60'. The gift one has the same problems.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This item is one of several I purchased from the good grips line. They are pretty easy to clean too. I use mine for some small quantities of baking needs, but am buying the .5 quart version because the squares are not quite what I had in mind as they are very shallow and wide.

I have had no issues with these locks so far. They are very bright and easy to use. I am very pleased with these locks. I have had them for about a month now and the light is very strong. They are very bright and I have them on my desk and in my work bag so they don't get lost. I would recommend these locks to anyone looking for a well made lock. I bought these to replace my old faucets and they are great!  I have used them for almost a month now and they are well made and have a very good feel to them.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"In terms of overall durability, they're great, but they do scratch very easily."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"So I have had this fan for a little over a week now. The thing to know about this is it does what it says! It is a swamp cooler that moves air through a wet pad. If you live somewhere that is dry and you know swamp coolers work in your region, then this will work.

My unit uses about a full tank of water every day and a half. I live in south central Texas. The only time I really can tell a difference in the air temperature is when I add ice to the water. This moves a lot of air and has many settings such as swing mode, high, medium, low, nature which alternates between the three, and a timer mode. You also have the option to turn the cooling on and off.

This fan does what it is advertised to do as long as you are using it in a dry climate. It moves a lot of air and could even be used as a humidifier.

UPDATE
I have now had this for about a month. I have taken great care of it. It literally was taken out of the box, placed in a corner on flat ground, and turned on and off each day. It worked well for the first month but it is now leaking! I am a handy person and I still can't figure out where the water is coming from. The water storage is in great condition so it has to be something with the hose line or water catching system from the wet pad. I can't figure out where it is coming from. The zip ties used to secure the hose are tight. I'm pretty dissatisfied after spending about $100"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Received the item before the shipping due date.  It is exactly what I wanted except for the tassel,  I wished it could have been taken out so I could place a real tassel in the frame.  Otherwise, great item for its price.  Look good hanging on the wall."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I was excited to get this set, as it is a very nice piece of equipment.  It is so small that it is not worth the extra money you spend on it.  The only thing I would change is the size of the curtain.  This is a very good curtain.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a large curtain and wants to add a little more detail to their curtain.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a very classy curtain.love this!  it works well, but I wish it was more sturdy, not just the front and back of the lid.  it doesn't have a lot of weight to it.  I had to buy two sets to make it.I bought these to use in a dresser for a baby shower.  They work great.  I used them for our shower.  We had them on our bed and they were pretty heavy.  I used them for the bedding for a 5 year old and she loves them.  They are very soft and comfortable.  The color is exactly as pictured.  They are very soft and wash well.  They are not heavy.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These were a little smaller than I had intended, but that's because I didn't pay attention to the size in ounces and then go compare them to one of my older glasses that are similar. But, you know what? That's GOOD, because I'm less likely to overdrink various poured liquids that are high in calories. I like THAT. And, they're less fragile as a result. I'm impressed by the fact that these are more durable in their base than the larger ones I used to break too often, being glass. So, it all works out. They're also easily cleaned by hand; whereas, the larger ones I had were deep and harder to get into the corners of inside the base."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,These have a heavy base and an easy to grip handle.  The only reason I gave them 5 stars is because the box is a bit small but the plastic lid does hold it together.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the lid was cracked.  The lid is not a very strong lid.  I will update if I have any issues with the lid.  I just put the lid on and the lid is on.  I will update if I have any problems with the lid.These are great.  I love that they are made of fiberglass.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"When it comes to warmth and overall quality I'd say its durable and very warm. Would not suggest hot summer/spring nights, it gets way to warm and you find it hard to stay comfortable. It stays together when you wash it.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"First thing I noticed is that the escutcheon *looks* nice with the nickel finish, but it is cheap plastic.  I have no doubt that after a few good cleanings, even the most modest of scrubbing pads would leave this looking awful.

Second thing is that it didn't even fit.  I'm replacing an original Moen trim kit.  My originial sits flush to the wall.  This one has about a 3.5"" ring that needs to be recessed into the wall by 1/4"" - not something easy to accomplish on an existing tile wall.  I have about a 2"" diameter hole where the valve comes out, but it's not big enough.  You can see what I'm talking about in the product picture - where the handle is attached, you can see that circle there and how it is recessed.

The one nice thing (not that it benefitted me at all) is that this kit tries to replace both old & new Moen configurations by providing several inserts to choose from.  This way you can match it to most Moens regardless of how your current one screws in to the valve.

I'm looking for a different kit that 1) sits flush and 2) might have a more durable faceplate."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,"Okay, so I finally got around to buying the tools. I did not need a screwdriver, but I had some old saws, and they were the best. I was very pleased with the tools. I used them to cut a strip of wood, and they worked great. The only thing I would change is I would not use the blades to cut a strip of wood if I could get my hands on them. I used them to cut a cut with a saw, and they were great. I would recommend this tool to anyone. I love these lamps. They are brighter than my old ceiling fan. I have used them for a couple of months now. They do work well for my purposes. The only issue is that I can't see them in my ceiling. I wish they were the ones that look like the ceiling lights. I would definitely recommend this lamp. Works as advertised. This is my second pair of these, and I really like the quality of the material and the design. They are very easy to install, and the rubber part of the handle is very easy to handle, and I like that it holds a bit more weight than the regular plastic handle. I don't have any problems with the quality of the finish, but it's a little tough, and if you're going to be using it for anything other than decorative purposes, it will not hold up to the use. I'm a homeowner and would definitely buy another pair. This is a very nice pair of LED lights, very bright. I have used them for a few projects and have been using them for a couple of days now."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I've used these gloves for shop and yard work for almost 20 years, getting 2-3 years out of every pair.  The small size is hard to find, but it makes for a tight, second skin.  I try to stay one new pair ahead of each glove change.
My order on 10/15/15 had not been received by 3/23/16, so I cancelled it and re-ordered on 3/23/16 under the assumption the quoted 1-2 week delivery time was accurate.  I finally received the gloves 10/13/16, almost one year after ordering them."

Fresh thin carrots are the test- those other peelers gouged the carrot so you would see the middle. Use this because you can safely peel without ruining the carrot. You can sweep it back and forth rather fast also- it does a great job!!!!!!!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Do your homework.  If installing these bulbs into existing, voltage-controlled halogen system(s), note that these bulbs are not electronically voltage controlling, like traditional style light bulb replacement LED bulbs.  These are simply LEDs soldered to a circuit board that passes current through it, allowing all LEDs to receive power.  Halogen systems draw too much power for these led bulbs, causing an LED ""misfire"", where pulse pattern locks into low light mode, which is very dim.  These discs are designed to be used in systems where the voltage is easily controlled and regulated, such as 12V DC.  Not recommended for household (120V AC) use without an LED controller, which is not cost effective for under-cabinet lighting."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"After a total house remod was done I wanted to clean a few area rugs to get them looking decent prior to giving them away or selling them for a few bucks.  This particular area rug was kept in the house through tile removal dust, walls being torn down, construction workers, etc., it was filthy and I thought for sure it had stains that would not come out but boy was I wrong!  I could not believe how much dirt came out with this Hoover, much more than meets the eye so it definitely does a good deep cleaning.  I had to fill the water and solution containers and empty the extracted dirty water several times but it was worth the time and effort to get this rug clean, so much so that I've decided to keep this one as it almost looks new!  It's so nice to have a carpet cleaner in the house that I can just whip out when I have an extra hour to brighten up the rugs.  I always dreaded going to the store to rent one, lugging it home and back to the store when done.  This Hoover will pay for itself in a year.  In the first pic you can see how much cleaner the left strip of the rug is compared to the right side.  The 2nd pic was taken after I was done.
Pros:  It does a great job cleaning, better than I expected.  It's very easy to put together and use.  All the containers slip in and out of place with ease.  I like that the cord is not so long to where you have to carry it around or worry about it getting caught in the wheels.
Cons:  If your rugs are super dirty as this one was, be prepared to fill the water container and empty the dirty water many times.  This won't be an issue for maintenance once the first deep cleaning is done."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"The Good:

The Cathedral top looks nice and the design is comfortable. The Bad:

The bottom is too small for the most typical desktop, but if you're a 4'2"" person, it's not too large. If you are going to use it for a full sized kitchen, it's a good idea to get a larger one. The Frigidaire top is great, but I wish there was an additional design. I think the design is better suited for small kitchens, but I'd be happy with the Frigidaire version. I'm glad I found this review helpful. It helps me to make my own decisions. I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to others. Very good quality. Very good for the price. very goodI love this little bag. I have a small kitchen and my bag keeps food from drying out.

I read directions in manual just because wise thing to do. I opened the fly nut 6 or 7 times and ran it until air was out of hydraulic line. After retightened I decided to check oil on the stick after reading reviews about oil being at lowest line from factory. I tilted it up on end and put 7mm hex in nut and will not move. I mean will not turn loose. So I called 800 number. Got a very pleasant gentlemen on phone that told me that's because they use thread lock so it will not leak in transit. He said you have to give the hex wrench a hard tap to break the glue or use a lock creasant  wrench (vise-grips) to lock on the round end of hex dip stick and give that a tap to loosen. This is not in the manual. Word of advise: Do not strip your 7mm hex nut, use the lock wrench and tap it and behold it is loose. Then screw it out with hex wrench that is included. I found the hydrologic oil to still be between the lines. Then I spent about 3 hours splitting about half a cord of wood. it went through my hard sweet gum ball wood like butter( if you get it with the grain). Stacked it and covered it and done. Also use some kind of silicone spray on the black and red back and forth stuff. Oil will cause wood chips to stick to it. And it helps to prevent screeching sounds. Great price, great design, great one handed control. I'll never wear this thing out. I bought from amazon there 50 foot 12 guage 15 amp cord and it works great with no issues. great price also

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I have no doubt that this is an amazing showerhead. I was confident in this when I got this showerhead because I have other Grohe fixtures in my home, and they are awesome. So, I have every confidence in the quality of this fixture.

My problem with it is that while it says ""retro-fit,"" which would seem to indicate that it can be retrofitted to just about any shower out there, assuming that the shower has enough room to fit the unit, which mine did. The problem (for me, anyway) is that the fixture is so heavy, it needs to be anchored into the wall with huge screws both on the top of the unit and the bottom. So, you have to have the structure inside the wall of your shower in order to have something to anchor those screws into. I happen to have an older home, and while my shower was re-done recently, (not by me), the structural integrity just isn't there. Luckily, the plumber I hired to put this unit in, realized this before he got too far into it.

So, the bottom line is that, again, while this is a ""retro-fit"" showerhead, it will not work for every shower, and you need to be very careful to know whether or not your shower can work with this unit...not just in terms of size, but in terms of structural integrity inside the walls...before you buy it.

I was unable to install this unit, but I'm still giving this a four star rating. Why? Just based on my previous experience with Grohe products...knowing how great the quality is with this company. I also thoroughly inspected all the parts of this when the plumber opened the package, and all parts for this are heavy, well made, and high-quality. I'm keeping this unit because I plan to re-do my bathroom one day soon, and I am definitely going to use this once I do."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I can honestly say I am famous for my mashed potatoes within my family and my husband's family. Every family dinner or get together that calls for mashed potatoes, there's no discussion on whose making it- everyone knows it's me. I'll take the title as the mashed potato master.

I have gone through endless amounts of potato mashers and have had handles fall off on me a few times. I just hated the design on them as I would get faitued easily. It's a workout- you'll definitely break a sweat mashing potatoes for 20 people!

When I saw this masher and the handle design I had to have it. Upon opening the package, I was so excited when I picked it up and felt how comfortable it was in my hand, and most importantly how strong and sturdy it was. There is no flimsiness to it what so ever.

I put it to the test with loaded mashed potatoes (sour cream, chives, bacon, cheddar cheese, the works). You can apply much more pressure with little effort and mash more effectively without tiring yourself out. The consistency also turned out better. This is exactly what I needed! I will use this masher so often and I have no concerns of it failing on me. My family members all want one now too. Thank you for making my job easier eternal chef! I have not yet used the peelers (I have my ""go to"" potato peeler I will not cheat on). This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."

I went for the silicon rings as I'd tried a metal egg ring my daughter loaned me and wasn't happy with it, size or clean up. These rings work GREAT! The are perfectly sized to make sandwiches using either English muffins or regular slices of bread. Cleanup is fast and easy unless you let them sit for a few hours (won't do that again) in which case it still takes minimal effort. Packaging was fine although when I first opened the box and packaging I noticed the rings didn't lay flat. However, the instructions say to let them sit 30 seconds on the hot pan which lets them flatten out. Had no issues with seepage. I also wasn't impressed with the suggestion to add some water and cover them while cooking, but I tried it and now do it every time. My only negative is the ""Free Bonus"" eBook which is essentially a poorly thrown together slide show with unimpressive links. As I didn't buy the rings for the free book, that didn't impact my rating. BTW, my daughter asked for the link so she could order a set."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Love these hangers! I've been trying to find kids size/baby size velvet hangers for a while now. Target (the store that has everything) didn't have them online nor in store. When I did find them in store, the value was overpriced for a pack of 5 or 10, but 30 of these hangers for $12 is such a good value! I rated this review 4 stars because the product isn't PERFECT (see images attached) which most AmazonBasics products I've bought, in the past have been. I compared the hangers to the original ""Delta Baby Hangers"" (white) my daughter has had since she was born as well as ""Kid Sized Hangers"" from Ikea (blue) just to show customers a better idea of the size. I was concerned they were going to be a lot bigger, but couldn't tell from most of the pictures. They are actually standard baby size so they can fit baby clothes just fine! I love the velvet because it prevents my daughters clothes from slipping off like traditional plastic hangers. There were a couple defects like several of the hooks broke off when I tried to straighten the hooks (they came uneven), but if you're like me and don't care about a couple defects, then for the value, they are worth purchasing. Quick summary,

PROS:
- Great value for the quality
- Standard ""baby size"", i.e. can fit baby clothes
- For the most part, good quality
- PRIME shipping!

CONS:
- Hooks aren't straight
- Several hangers broke straight out the package
- Not a varied color selection (BLACK / WHITE!!!!), the polka dot ones look kind of tacky

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"My H2O mop gave out after a little better than a year; I should have taken an extended warranty as offered, but, then, how does one send the darned thing back if the original box for shipping hasn't been saved?  My problem early on was I felt the floor was so wet when I finished and took a long time to dry; I called the company and a woman I spoke with suggested going over an area with mop on and then click it off and go over the same area again without the steam being expelled.  That was fine.  But was it the frequent clicking on and off that caused the mop to eventually cease to work?  I took it to a repair place near where I live, but they could do nothing with it.  So I'm out the mop.  I've gone back instead to the Hoover Floormate, which, really, is a much better piece of equipment...and does do grout!  We have an older Florida home with terrazzo floors, and the Floormate is ideal on them, as, in a way, was the H2O mop.  But the Floormate both expels and draws up moisture.  That would be the big drawback to the mop."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"As I have been replacing all of my outdated appliances, both small and large, with newer, faster, fancier models, I thought that this replacement for my 25-year old toaster would be ""the bomb"".

 Unfortunately I was to be disappointed. The ""forward-facing"" slots are convenient, and the little lever that allows you to lift your toast out when it is done are well-designed. The toaster sensitivity buttons allow for a range of settings (burnt-just warmed). There is a button for ""thawing"" but I have yet to see that it does anything other than toast the item inserted. The slots are wonderfully wide for even the largest bagel, yet accomodate regular bread well. The stay-cool to the touch outside is very nice.

 The problem? It toasts one side crispy, the other luke-warm. I find it necessary to switch slots and give it an extra few seconds (as the left slot cooks more on the right side, and the right slot cooks more on the left side).

 All in all this is just an expensive excuse for an regular toaster, and a mediocre one at that."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Excellent replacement tubes for florescent fixtures.  These will save about half the energy I use on my traditional florescent light.  I plan to purchase additional LED tubes.

The box was packaged in a very large package with a small box of packing tape on it.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great gift.  I love the color and the size.  It is a great quality product.  I would buy it again.  I am very happy with it.This is a great product for the price. It works well, but I wish it was more sturdy"

Sticks like a bumper sticker so clean your surface first."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Great Disposer, We had an old house and the tools were all in a box. I was just starting to get tired of the plastic bags. The box was filled with a lot of metal and it was hard to get the tools out. I had to use some of the tools with the edge of the tool to get it out. The box was very heavy so I had to get some extra tools to get it out of the box. I ended up using a bit of a small bit of wood to get the tools out. They were very well made and the tool bag was very easy to use. The tool bag is very heavy so it takes a lot of work to get it out of the box."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,these are awesome on your pocket or purse.  I've also used them for a few hours.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,I am using R438A (R22 drop in replcement) and R134A for my car A/C and my old (relatively speaking) leak detector would not respond to either of these refrigerants. The MyPin Pro however works on older refrigerants and these new blends with very good sensetivity at a modest price.  Highly recommend this product.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she loved it.  It's been a great gift and we plan to use it for many years to come.This is a great fan. It is quiet and does the job.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"I bought the 20-piece set as a trial, along with some Wallace flatware that cost a bit more.
I would say these are an OK value for the price.  They are attractive though I wish the contrast were a bit more.
The Wallace pieces are heavier and have 18-10 stainlesss, meaning they have 8%-10%  nickel which gives them shine and means they are less likely to rust.

I do like the design and I'd keep these if I didn't have the money to buy better flatware, and they could replace some cheap pieces I already own.
But as it is I just gave these to a friend who needs some flatware."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"The old version of this fan was installed 12 years ago in my bathroom.  It had started to struggle, then I broke the cover changing the bulb.  I bought this current model, same model number, and was an almost exact duplicate.  I was able to leave the housing mounted in the ceiling, and replaced only the fan assembly.  The new model is more quiet than the old one."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"My husband and I enjoy this set and the price is good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy. I would not recommend this product to anyone. This is a great value. The reviews said it was a great size, but it is not. It's not a very large towel. It's just a towel with a towel holder. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the material is very soft, but I'm sure it will last a very long time. I just wish the material was more absorbent. I have used it a couple of times, and it feels great. I'll buy another one to make my laundry easier. Very good quality. Very thin."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"(Update: The heater stopped working after less than two weeks. Thankfully I am still inside the return date.) I can't recommend this unit at all if it isn't going to work any longer than that.)

I'm going to have to swallow my pride and re-write this review. This little heater has actually impressed me a lot. It could be better, but it is not bad at all. This heater stays cool to the touch and the coils don't get very hot seemingly but it has some pretty good output. It takes a while to bring a room up to temperature but once it's there it really holds it there. It is 25 degrees outside and the heater is keeping my living room at an even 65 all by itself. It could be better but not much. It is actually a pretty impressive little heater."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,it is just a generic shower head you can buy at home depot for the same price  very noisy but has  has removable water flow protector
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"This was an impulse lightning deal buy. I own a few ceramic blade knives. A couple of folders and a chefs knife. Those are decent tools. Sharp enough to shave hair. This box cutter wouldn't be so bad if it had any kind of edge on it. I'm not talking shaving here I just mean an EDGE! I have sharper butter knives. It still cuts through packing tape but going through cardboard ain't so easy. This thing has an auto retracting blade. It requires constant tension with your thumb to hold the blade out while trying to hold onto the cutter. This in combination with the dull blade makes cutting though tougher materials harder than it needs to be. If they had just sharpened it a little bit more it would work so much better. The magnet is a nice touch and makes it more accessible. Still, I'll stick with my metal blade box cutter and just be careful. Another thing to keep in mind, ceramic blades are harder than metal blades but that means they are more brittle too. Put too much sideways pressure on this blade and it will break like a clay pot .It can't be returned! No Dilly! UPDATE: I was too harsh with my review of this little dude. After using it more I've change my mind about one thing. It does exactly what it is designed to do. Open packages and boxes. All of my earlier criticisms were warranted. It sucks at cutting up cardboard. The retractable blade while being a valid saftey feature is still a pain. Maybe it will wear in after more use. The cerramic blade could be sharper but it suffices for cutting packing tape and soft packaging. But I am also glad it was unreturnable. This forced me to use it more and see it's value. It gets another star for effectiveness. I'm still glad I didn't pay full price for it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Works great and less than the shark brand! wiil and have bought again
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a good down pillow at a great price. I bought my first down pillow over 10 years ago after a lot of testing. No, it wasn't this one -- but it also was three times the price of this one.

When we got our Tempurpedic bed, I switched to the Tempurpedic pillow for a couple of years. But I wasn't able to lay on my side as much because I couldn't breathe as well. So I kept my eyes open for a good lower-priced down pillow.

I stayed at several Hilton and Hilton Garden Inn hotels that featured the Touch-of-Down pillow sets. Several times this pillow stuck out as my favorite. On one trip I wrote down the details to check into it later. But I couldn't wait so I ordered it while I was at the hotel.

I'm liking it. For an across-the-board comparison it would only get 4 stars compared to my earlier 5 star down pillow. But at one-third the price, it's a 5 star in its own right.

It is basically a pillow within a pillow, but only occasionally can I tell that. The inner section gives a little more support, but I don't know that I need it myself.

The only downside was that I had to buy the protective cover separately -- on my earlier more expensive down pillow it came stock with the pillow -- which was probably another reason it was more expensive.

If you really want to try out some pillows (down, synthetic, and mixed) try one of the Hilton hotels with the Touch-of-Down program. My visits have been on business trips, but they could be romantic nights out or any other reason. It's kinda like renting a car to try it before actually forking over the money -- a worthwhile expense."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,"This handy and simple to use. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver.

I had to replace the tool with another one because the first one broke and the second one had no way to turn it on. I ended up with this one.

I love it. I have it in my pocket, and I have it with me on my car. I just carry it with me everywhere I go. The only thing I would change is the price. I paid $80 for a tool, but I really hate that I have to pay $80 for a tool. I am glad I bought it because it is worth every penny. It is a very good tool for the price. I would recommend it for any person who needs a tool for a project.It works like a charm.  I have used it for about a year and it still works.  I bought the Dewalt 6V in November of 2014.  I have not used it yet.  I just needed a power supply to power my furnace.  I don't know how long it will last.  I know it will be working for about a year or so.  It's not a huge deal but it's a nice feature.  I would recommend this product to anyone.Works great on my second door. It is well made and it works great. It comes with a cap and is a handy bit to use with a little bit of extra plastic. The 2 wire side is heavy duty and the 3 wire side is solid. It is very flexible. I have been using it for a few months now and it is a little heavy to use on my 2nd door. This is a nice tool to"

It's very easy to clean the surface of the pads, and they're very easy to get used to.  I'm very pleased with it.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.This is a very good lamp.

It's pretty deep so if they throw a lot of toys in, it can be difficult to dig down to the bottom, but the red part on top is only attached with velcro, so my 4-year-old is able to remove it if he needs to. My only complaint is that the yellow slide up lid comes off CONSTANTLY. I can put it back so it's not that big of a deal, but just something to be aware of. You can design it however you like, the stickers on it come on a sheet, so he enjoyed having some input in the decorating. Would buy again. Gets the job done, his room is much neater now."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"First off, this thing is big. If you don't have an application that requires a big, long spout, this is probably not a good choice for you. I did need one because I have a large soaker tub with a wide rim and a wall mounted faucet. It was really tough to find a long wall mounted spout that wasn't really expensive. I also wanted one without a diverter, but that just wasn't going to happen, so I settled on this one and just removed the diverter. The spout itself is pretty solid and installation was easy. You can install it in three ways: 1) with a short MPT stub, 2) with a long MTP stub, or 3) with a o-ring-sealed slip fit. My only complaint is that the quality of the finish is not great. There are visible cross-hatch marks in the finish. It's not scratched (if it was I would have returned it for a replacement). It appears to be just the way these are made - the metal is not getting polished to a sufficient degree. Unless you're a perfectionist like me, this probably won't bother you, but I wanted to mention it."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These shouldn't even be a question whether to buy or not. If you get the Harman Kardon HKTS 14 or 8 speakers, get these stands. You won't regret it!!! Unless, of course you are hanging your speakers on the wall. I liked these because they not only lift to perfect height but look so impressive too. I bought two Harman Kardon stereo setups for my house, a AVR 240 and the CP 15 with the AVR 135. I bought four sets of stands because I don't want to mount speakers to wall and these do the trick perfectly. They are very well constructed and the base at floor is heavy enough that you won't worry about them getting knocked over too easily. The wires run up through the middle which is great and bases are slightly grooved up on rear to allow wires to pass through without making the stands sit uneven. They come with rubber feet so they won't scratch my wood floors and if you have carpet, they also come with little spikey type of nails to help them stay put. They are easy to put together that each pair only took 5 minutes to complete. Harman Kardon really does make a quality product both in the receivers and speakers and these speaker stands are no exception."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Hooked one of these bad boys up to my sons Xbox and TV and programmed it with my SmartThings Hub.  No more watching TV all night hahaha.  It goes off at midnight and will allow the TV/xbox to come back on at 6:30.  I have another one setup to a lamp with a motion detector to light the way to the bathroom for the kids at night.  Great product.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Great product, easy to apply. The nice thing about this design is that you can use it horizontal or vertical. We wanted to cover a window that was about 60 inches wide and 30 inches tall. Didn't think it would look good if we had to use more than one piece. Most privacy screens that were the right size had a design that could only be used vertically and were max of 36 inches wide, so wouldn't work for us. Finding a privacy screen (other than plain etched) that works horizontally was awesome."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,CG,Used for 2 weeks and works great.  It is a little heavy for my small size and doesn't move as easily

I would not buy again. Great.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Great light bulb. I'm using 8 of these on a track in our living room and they work great.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,I could not be happier with this item. I've used it for a couple of years now and it works very well. I also have the TRS-10 and it's still working well. I would definitely buy this again. I bought this to replace a broken one I had. I love the fact that I can use the auto adjuster so I don't have to worry about adjusting the wire. The only reason I didn't buy this is because I had to cut the wire before the new one was installed.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,To be fair I have several Streamlight products and really love them all... and this little light is no different.  Other lights may have more settings but I just want to click the ON button ONCE and get all 35 Lumens every time. Solid quality construction. Love the reverse clip. Reliable!!! Oh and some say there are smaller lights than this as if that was a negative for the Microstream. NOPE this light is plenty small. There is such a thing as too small. Those of you will big hands like me know exactly what I'm talking about.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,CG,"Update
Now that I have used this tool, I feel confident that it will hold up well.  The other two I had to replace, both with the same plastic handle.  I used this to hold up the smaller drill bits in a bit holder.  This holds the drill bits in the bit holder.  I also like the fact that the plastic handle on the drill bits has a plastic handle on top.  I like the fact that the bit holder is a bit holder so that you can flip the bit holder onto the bit holder.  I'm not sure why I got the big drill bits, but I like the fact that they have a plastic handle.  It's a bit holder that you can flip to a bit holder.  It's a bit holder that you can flip to a bit holder.  It's a bit holder that you can flip to a bit holder.  I'm not sure why I got the big drill bits, but I like the fact that they have a plastic handle on top.

I'm very happy with the purchase.  I'm going to have to wait until the spring to remove it and use it again.  I have a lot of experience with this tool and I have a lot of experience with the little drill bits and the little bit holder.

I'm glad I got these bits.  I bought them because I wanted a tool that would hold up to the use of a little drill bits in a bit holder.  I didn't need them to hold up, so I just used them.  I'm happy with the purchase.Great price and a great product.The little and the big is not the same.  This is a big tool"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"After many years of thinking about what I was going to do with this, I decided to go with a pair of the best. The first time I put them on, it was so much better. I still use them every day, they are perfect for what I need. The second time I put them on, I noticed that they are very comfortable and well built. I like the way they hold the hose securely and they do not bend. The third time I put them on, they were so much better. I have used them every day,"

The plastic is a bit rough and rough to put together and the wood is a bit rough.  This one is a bit cheaper than the other one.  I love the color and the wood is very well made.  I also like the shape of the handles and the fact that the metal is smooth
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,I was really just looking for something that would exactly fit what the builder had used on my home so I wouldn't have to drill new holes. This was pretty much a replica of what I had and fit perfectly. Seems to work great.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"This is a good alternative if you don't want to drill into your bathroom tile or spend too much money on an all metal kit.  Just keep in mind that this kit utilizes plastic mounting hardware and significant effort is needed to adjust the height of the shower head holder with just your thumb - the holder is spring loaded and uses a very heavy duty spring (its the most durable part of the whole kit).  I wouldnt recommend this item to anyone with arthritis!  I promptly returned this kit and purchased an independent shower head holder that used a high quality suction cup.  With my disabilities, I needed to be able to maintain the shower head at a fixed position, just at a lower height.  Still, if you're in need of an affordable solution to an adjustable height shower head holder, this might be for you.  However, if you have arthritis, you may want to keep shopping."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I'd checked other options since last summer, and have acquired enough 2 liter seltzer bottles to start a bottle tower garden.
Did not want to buy into a proprietary soda-making system, but that seemed the only option till I chanced on a review of the Mastrad Purefizz.
From the design and operation of the Purefizz to the fact that the chargers are recyclable, this is a winner.
It arrived today, right on schedule. On my first attempt, I made two yummy egg creams using the chocolate syrup recipe Rachel Meeks provides on her small notebook dot org site. She credits Amy D of The Complete Tightwad Gazette for the recipe.

Though I ordered from Mastrad, I thank Amazon and the previous product reviewers who convinced me to get this gem.

Updated 041715: Can I add a star? I made seltzer water a few weeks ago and forgot about it in the fridge. Opened the Mastrad last night and poured a lovely glass of fizzy water. One more this morning. Surely didn't expect the bubbles to last so long - and I'm not counting on this happening again.
After seeing reviews about rust at the bottom and metallic taste: I've had this nearly a year and keep it, full or empty, in the fridge. It's great.
Keeping the Purefizz and the water very cold prior to use and in between uses has worked well. I use the pressurized top when returning the Purefizz to the fridge, where it stays unless it's making a new batch of seltzer. And it never goes in the dishwasher."

It occationally tripped the 15A circuit breaker that we had other appliances running on.

I had a lot of trouble with the box and the cover was very large.

The box is in good shape, and it's easily protected.

I have the rubber seal on the cover, and it's a good seal.

I've had the box for a few months now and it seems to be working fine.

This is a very nice tool for the price.

If you need a tool that is not made in China, this is a good one.

I do recommend it.

This tool is a great tool for the price.

The leather on the handle is solid and well made.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,I love these lights. They have the wide beam and the smoothness of a yellow light. They are so bright that I am not worried about having to walk to the bathroom in the dark to see them. It is a very nice light. I would recommend this to anyone.I bought two of these as a gift to my wife.  She loved them.  She has them all over her house.  I love them all!  They are all a perfect size for her and she loves them all.These are great.  I love that they are made of fiberglass instead of plastic.  They work great.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"These Tekton wrench holders are wonderful. They are made of good solid but flexible plastic and will hold most wrench's and spanners. I used them to hold metric and SAE open end, open end ring (combination) and ring spanners and found they tidied up my tool box leaving much more room and making the tools identifiable at a glance. You can cut them to fit and I found a small band saw did the best job but a sharp blade would work as well. I highly recommend these."

To be fair, it has been cloudy and raining a lot lately and our house is surrounded by 80 foot oak trees that are several hundred years old so those trees also limit the light that reaches the solar cells that power this light.  The one light that worked great was the only one in a position to get enough sunlight. The rest were in shade all day and never came on.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Perfect small scale! Easy to use and compact size makes it convenient for travel.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"An oven mitt isn't really the kind of thing I put a lot of thought into, but in using this one, I've quickly come to appreciate the difference between an afterthought and an item borne of deliberate design.

I got this to replace a potholder I'd used for years, and I immediately appreciated the advantage of not having to worry about dropping it or slipping my grip. The design allots plenty of hand flexibility, and this is especially noticeable in the thumb area- All-clad promotes the thumb design on this product, and with good reason, as it allows total flexibility, which is crucial when handling hot pans and pots.

The craftsmanship is first-rate, and the grip and insulation are good- I never felt like I had a weak or unsteady hold on anything, and my hand never got warm, much less hot.

An oven mitt is a utility item that gets used daily; to my way of thinking, paying a bit more for an exponentially higher-quality mitt is an obviously good investment."

You can't just plop in the corner ""as is"" .... if you want it to look somewhat realistic, it does require some primping, which is no big deal.  This fits the bill for the bare spot in my TV room.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I have tried a few other lamps. The non-diode are too hot, and the multi-diodes kept flickering and going out one-by-one, so I went simple and liked the looks of this one. You have to attach the lamp to the base, but the instructions are good and it only takes 5 minutes. I have big hands, so the two Philip head screws underneath were a bit fiddly. The base is iron and heavy, with a plastic surround and a felt-like pad underneath.

The light is focused and quite aim-able. The neck holds its place well. From one foot (30 cm) up, the lens spreads the main light to a circle with a diameter of about 1 feet, which is what I desired.

I it simple, elegant, and does exactly what I want. Other reviewers say the switch goes bad after a while and causes the light to flicker, but apparently it can be replaced rather easily if that happens (I hope IKEA reads those reviews and works on a better switch, as it seems to be the only down side - for some - for this very nice product)."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,This little light lives a long time and shines very bright.  I also like the fact that the light is adjustable.  I am using it in the garage to cover a lot of concrete.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Beautiful glasses!  I have been using plastic thermal glasses and they always get water in between the walls...and plastic just isn't the same as glass.  These glasses are very nice.  Smooth and thick and do not sweat.  I haven't put them in the dishwasher yet, so we'll see if they hold up.  They are a pricey, but if they hold up are really worth it.  Am going to buy a few more."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I'll be honest, when I first saw the picture of these gloves, my husband and I shared a great laugh, as they looked so silly! But my laughter quickly turned to intrigue as I realized that this could be exactly what I've been looking for to clean my toddlers sippy cups! So I went ahead and ordered a pair and hoped for the best. I am happy to report that they have become my best friend in the kitchen! You see, sippy cups have all of these little crevices in the tops which traps milk particles, dishwasher residue, etc. Also, if you don't find a lost toddler cup in time, the dried up drink inside can prove to be a real pain to remove. Normally I wrap a soapy dishcloth around a butter knife and get in the crevices and deep into the cup that way. Well no more!! These gloves have eliminated so much work and so many dirty dishcloths for me! They fit just perfectly, and the fact that one is a regular glove allows for easy handling of dishes. The sponge side is what does the trick for the crevices and the bottom rims of the cups, and the scrubby side has made removing dried up milk and chocolate syrup a breeze! I wish someone had thought of these sooner ! 5 stars!!

 100lbs capacity, they will be able to hold almost anything you can put on them
 Many different lengths, this review is for the 16 inch, but they have many sizes
 Super easy to install, just some screws and off you go

Con's
 If you using them with the bottom mount adapters we had to make our own hole for one of them, but worked out
 Can be annoying to line up and make sure they are level
 Gets your hands a little greasy if you mess with them a lot

Conclusion
For an overall project these are great. easy to work with and heavy duty. Take your time when installing them to make sure they line up and are level. Completely worth the price."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I have had this teacup for a couple of weeks and I really love it. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The colors are great. The color is nice and deep.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"After a full summer of mostly cloudless days, where the sun set at around 9, and a full day of exposure to mostly direct sunshine, the lights go out at between one and two in the morning. This is our second set of these, and the first set performed the same. Along with the B.S. claim of how long they stay lit, two of them quit working completely-no light whatsoever. They look nice on, and off, but are definitely not worth the premium price we paid for them. We were hoping the second set would work out, but no such luck. Trying different batteries didn't change the lighting problem."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"These are soooooo instrumental in keeping me happy with my purchase. I also like the fact that they do not have the dishwasher, which is nice!  I'm a very large fan of the blades and this one is a perfect addition. I really like that it comes with a rubber seal to keep my blades from scratching each other. I also like the fact that the blade is very easy to clean and that the blades are on a smooth surface. I love that they come with a tray for easy storage, but I really like that they come with a small trash can for storage, and that they have a magnet on one side for easy storage. I also like that the blades are larger than I thought. It also helps to keep my blades clean even if I accidentally scratch them."

My Newfie can  go in and out without a problem. One year old and is still in fantastic shape considering I do not have a covered deck.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"The real star in this kit is the Magnepull.  Incredibly strong magnet that will be sufficient for any type of pull in any given wall cavity.  The letdown is definitely the Magnespot which has a rather wide margin of errorabout 4 to 5 beyond the actual center, and a severely limited range of approximately 3.5 to barely 4, which is not enough to even get a reading through a average width wall with no insulation.  I would just save some money and go with the Magnepull kit by itself."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This DII Halloween Skeleton table runner looks really cool. I am using in the classroom when we study the human skeleton system or during Halloween week. However it came wrinkled, so I need to iron it prior to use and will likely hang it up a wall or in front of a book shelve. Also, I prefer that the tablecloths have a polyester blend to it so that they do not shrink in the dryer or wrinkle so easily and apparent. This is slightly see through and has only one stitching, so don't expect to last long, at-least wash it in the gentle cycle."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"I make my purchases based on what I know about these things.

I like that it automatically adjusts to the floor height -- go from bare floors to carpet easily.  The only disadvantage over my last Dirt Devil is that the hose is not connected.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This works great, unless you allow it to sit in pooled water.  The battery compartment will corrode quite quickly.  I brushed off the contacts with a wire brush, and elevated it.  It now works great!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"The Fulcrum 30030-308 wireless remote LED light is a simple and effective way to add light to a room or a closet that doesn't already have a light and a light switch. It's a battery-operated setup and remarkably easy to install with double-backed tape.

In fact, there is an on/off switch on the light itself so you don't even need to use the wireless remote to control the light if you're just adding the light to a small hallway closet or under a cabinet to light up a workbench. The built-in adjustable timer works great and automatically turns off the light after a pre-selected period of time (to save battery life) if you forget to turn off the light.

My only minor complaint is about the size of this set. I'm glad the light is ""tall"" from top to bottom and ""wide"" from side to side so that the light source is large enough to be both bright and soft instead of looking like a flashlight ... but the light fixture itself is pretty ""thick"" or ""fat"" from front to back and that makes it less than ideal if you're trying to hide this light under a cabinet or on the wall in a small closet. Similarly, the remote light switch is unusually large compared to how small other wireless on/off remotes are.

Bottom line, this works and I'm mostly happy with it, but I'd be even happier if the light fixture was ""flatter"" from front to back and the remote light switch was smaller."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Something I never expected when I bought it. I was expecting a lot of the same stuff. The top is a nice, solid piece of wood and the cover is very sturdy. It is hard to get the carpet out of the car if you don't have a lot of room. I have a few of them in the house and they are a little rough. I just put them on the floor and it is nice and smooth. I would not have given it 5 stars if it were not for the fact that the cover is not quite as thick as the carpet. I am happy with it and am happy with the price. It is a very good product for the price. The only negative is that I can't find a box of these for the price. I have only used them once so far and they are very good quality. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Very nice looking. I have not used it yet but I will update when I do. I got this for my daughter's first birthday party. She loves it!  I was very happy with the size and the quality. It is made from sturdy bamboo. I was able to use it on the bed and it is great to hold."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I'm very happy with these inexpensive manifolds. However, my crimper does not fit once the first line is crimped on (copper rings). I have a custom made threaded-bolt crimper that I bought from eBay - it's a life saver and fits perfectly into these small manifolds. The guy makes them on a CNC machine. The bolt crimper requires you to tighten two heavy duty bolts with a socket wrench but it allows you to get into tight spaces like this manifold and has cutouts for 1"", 3/4"", 1/2"" and 3/8"" - that's a lot of tool for like $40.

Note: I'm in no way affiliated with the toolmaker, but your standard crimper may not work."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"This is your typical cheap, made-in-China-esque product. That's fine, but it wasn't .99 - it was what, $6? I got it for evening walks with my dog and at first, I was really happy with it. It sheds a nice blue light and allows her to see where she's walking and, more importantly, allows passing cars to see both of us! It attached nicely to her collar.

Even before the clasp broke (in literally fewer than 10 uses), there were a couple issues--the light itself is very hard to turn on. I pressed both sides as hard as I could, and I ended up having to hit it against a wall to get the thing to turn on. Also, the clasp is difficult to get on a squirming dog. You'd think it would easily collapse so that you could slip it onto the collar...I don't want my dog wearing it all the time (just one more thing on her collar to jingle/get caught/etc.). But it's a hassle to get on. And yet, it broke after only a few uses!

All in all, not worth the money. It's a good idea, just poorly made."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Gotta use with the Quick Pitch systems which is great.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,It has been a fine slow cooker so far and looks very nice. I suspect after a couple years it will start breaking down since so much of it is plastic. We have gone through so many that are built like this but the more expensive ones don't seem to be any better in this regard nor do they cook any better based on my experience.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"We've had a couple of Chamberlain garage door openers for several years now, and they work just fine. I bought this remote as a replacement for one that was lost. I've had to replace the battery in one of the original remotes. It's a bit difficult to get the case open to replace the battery, but they last for around 5 years which seems pretty reasonable. The only indication that the battery was failing was a reduction in the operating range of the remote. Programming the remote is very simple (directions are provided with the unit), and it's nice to be able to use several remotes with both garage doors. The removable clip is nice, too, allowing you to carry the remote in a pocket with no sharp edges. Just remember: if you put the remote in your motorcycle jacket, zip it up before you go for a ride (see previous comment about a lost unit)."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,Product is no good. Only works 1 time out of 6 uses. Don't buy! It's a piece of crap. Not even going to give it away; throwing it in the trash. I waste of money!

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Installed near entry door at night. The only problem is that it's not really a doorbell. It's not very dimmable, but it is the lightest bulb I've used"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I seems odd to get all excited about a booklight, but this is honestly the best booklight I have ever owned and I have gone through a lot of them, being an insomniac night reader with an early-bedtime husband.

The most excellent feature on this little light is the very high quality metal gooseneck. It will move absolutely any way that you want it to go with ZERO bounceback. In addition to moving effectively right and left and up and down, the head of the light twists equally well and stays put.

The light itself is pleasing with 3 LEDs, and covers the page nicely from mass market paperbacks on up to hard cover releases (I have used it now for both, as well as a trade paperback.)  It is light enough to not bend or damage the book or be falling backwards.  The non-skid pad inside the back of the clip keeps it from sliding around the book or falling sideways as so many of my lights with slip on clips do.

The only caveat that I would mention is that you have to want a light that takes standard batteries.  This takes 3 AAAs, which I love as I can use rechargable batteries.  They are easy to change and don't add to much weight, but does make for a larger housing than some people want in their booklights.  I'll take that any day to having to dig up expensive and sometimes hard to find ""watch"" batteries.  I have yet to need to change the batteries after three large books worth of reading thanks to the LEDs.

The light has a full and dim setting which my husband appreciates when I am reading in bed.

If you are looking for a new booklight (and want one with standard batteries) you have found it.  I can't recommend this highly enough."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,just as others have written; it has the quality and function of a standard AA battery.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,So disappointed. I had one of these for 10 years until it finally broke.  I purchased this one and it broke as soon as I used it.  The design is flimsy and cheap.  The batteries fell out and the top doesn't stay put.  Night and day from the same make that I had for 10 years.  Must be made in China now.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Got these as a housewarming gift for a best friend who had moved into a house with 1 picture window and 3 oversized side windows.  These were such a deal (set of 2 panels) and was a neutral color that she had requested.  Okkkkk, let me say that the picture DOES NOT do these drapes justice.

We got three - 1/2 in. x 10 ft. steel conduit pipes (approx. $3.00 ea.), which I used a Dremel to cut down to size and two - 1/2 in. Electrical Metallic Tube (EMT) Set-Screw Connectors (pack of 5) to use as dowels and to keep the pipes from sliding off of the brackets for a total of $30.96 (total cost for all 4 windows) .  A decent heavy duty curtain rod will cost at least $20.00 for one window (not including the curtain rod bracket).
P.S.:  The curtain rod idea is just a FYI DIY for those looking to save a money and need a heavy duty curtain rod.  I use conduit pipes and copper (L) pipes as curtains rods for curtains with grommets throughout my house.

The thermos previously was very slow when pouring coffee and the update has a very good flow.  Additionally, the grinder, grinder cover and basket lid all are improved. Cuisinart says you should use the golden filter by itself.  This works, but the coffee is much weaker than I prefer.  A stronger brew can be had by using a paper filter with the basket.  My experience with the previous unit and this unit has been very positive.  However, it does require more cleaning than a typical coffee maker.  I clean the grinder and basket after each brew and rinse the Thermal carafe when done.  This has proven (to me) to be the easiest way to take care of the pot."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I bought this vacuum cleaner 3 months ago and absolutely love it!! I am 69 and have a lot of difficulty maneuvering my heavy Kenmore canister vacuum anymore. I have had other stick or similar size vacuums before, but always ended up being disappointed in their performance. Not this one!! This machine is very light but does a fantastic job at picking up dirt in spite of its size. I like the fact that the ""footprint"" is not wide like the usual uprights as it can do a better job of going in tight spaces. I like the transparent cup which is easy to empty without getting dirty hands in the process, the fact that you do not need to buy paper filters, the easy to disassemble construction if you want to give it a thorough cleaning. I also like the sponge type of filter that you just need to rinse thoroughly when too dirty. I actually bought additional filters in case I needed to do soso I would not have to wait for it to dry. The first time I used it I was shocked at the amount of dirt and cat hair I amassed! This was the only time so far I have had to disassemble and clean the inner tube. You know you have to do so because you notice that the suction then is poor.
As you can see, I am tickled pink! This is the perfect vacuum for seniors or small apartments.
The only thing which would make it better: a handle on the front at the cup height to help hold it when vacuuming say stairs or sofa.  A hose attachment would be nice too but can be easily be done without the old fashion way (broom/ brush and rag) For the price and the performance and ease I do not believe it would be fair to remove a star.
Note: I had misplaced the instruction notice, and could not read the one posted on their website. I contacted Hoover, a very nice man answered and very courteously sent me a new one."

It seemed more bother than it was worth to use. Now all my pieces are close by and fit neatly in a smaller plasic container that fits in the cupboard with the good china.  It was so easy to set the table for my last dinner party with the ""good stuff"". I especially like that I can pull out just the number of place settings that I need without having to bring out the entire service. I haven't had them long enough to see how well they prevent tarnish, but they definitely are convenient and keep the silverplate from getting scratched."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"There are several sized baskets among the reviews here; this is a review of the one they call the Medium.

The inside dimensions excluding the rounded top lip are just shy of 5-1/2"" wide by 15-1/2"" long by 5-3/4"" tall. The lip adds another 1/4"" to each side and the top thus the overall 6"" wide, 6"" deep and 16"" long in the specifications.

This is a nice sturdy basket, attractive, well made. It has sides which are pretty straight. Why is that important?

I'm picky but for a reason. Those with straight sides are better for organizing; the more slant on the sides of a basket the more it will take up excess room over the usable area, wasting storage space. You see too many of that kind on the market.

This basket joins numerous others being used to organize my refrigerator and freezer; everything in its place makes everything easy to find."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,My mother in law loved this rug and she loves it too. This rug is a great value. I had to replace a couple of pieces that were not in great shape and that were broken.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This adorable tea ball is both whimsical and well made. The ball is made of durable stainless steel. The handle is in the form of a green tea leaf and is made of food safe silicone. Because the handle is made of silicone, it will not get hot, not matter how hot the water for your brew is. The coordinating silicone drip tray is a very nice piece to set your tea ball on when you remove it from your cup.

This tea ball easily holds a full tablespoonful, which is the amount the major majority of my herbal teas suggest to use for a 1 cup portion. The silicone portion fits snuggly inside the stainless steel ball part, yet is very easy to pull apart. Everything cleans up very easily with soap and water, when washed by hand. I do not have an automatic dishwasher, so I have not washed it in that manner.

I have been very pleased with the quality and performance of this product. I purchased this item at the regular price at which it was offered for personal use. I did NOT receive any type of promotional discount in exchange for this review. All statements made in this review in regard to this product, represent my own genuine and honest opinions."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I've had one of these for 3 years now, and would still buy it all over again.

Yeh, it's a little heavy.  But I'll trade that for all the flimsy vacuums I had previously put together.  And really the only other vacuum that's even compared to this one was my Kirby from 10 years ago, and that thing was beyond heavy.  I'm female, and can take this thing up and down my stairs regularly, and though it is a little on the heavy side, it's WELL worth it in terms of cleaning power.

It has a ton of attachments right there where you can get to them easily, along with an easy yellow knob for switching between floor mode and hose, and you can of course adjust according to carpet height.  Sometimes I wish the hose itself was a little longer, but that's what the extenders are for.  Using the various attachments I can vacuum everything from throw rugs, to couches, to lampshades, ceiling cobwebs, fan grates, and just about anything else you can think of.  Just beware that it's powerful enough in floor mode to shred certain things unintentionally.  I learned this on one of my throw rugs.  The thing just gobbles up anything loose, what can I say?

Durability?  Heh, I've run this thing into walls, steps, you name it - it takes a scuff and keeps on going.

The one thing to be aware of with this vacuum is that you will need to be diligent about checking/changing the bag.  Because it sucks so well, the bag will fill up quickly.  I've made this mistake countless times (probably why I do find it a little heavier.. lol), because I let it get really full after being so used to my previous vacuums that didn't suck as well.  I can also say I've never needed to replace anything non-filter related on this ever - not even the belt.

Another thing I really love about it is the cord - it's super long!! :)

Would absolutely buy another one in a heartbeat."

If I held the balloon near a book I could comfortably read through the balloon.  I don't know if I was accidentally given the wrong color but the sticker stuck to my bag claims they're white pearlized balloons.  Honestly, I don't know what I would call the color and I don't picture anybody going to a party store and voluntarily choosing this color.  They look like they should have been clear balloons with a bit of shine to them but they look aged and yellowed."

I use mine in my medicine cabinet to organize my plethora of travel size soaps and sample products until I am ready to use them. I would also aggregator office supplies like post it's, binder clips and other similar items. It's made from clear plastic and has nice smooth edges and a very level bottom. The sides have a low profile that  make it easy to access items even if on a shelf. I have found its a great nail polish caddy, and for makeup items and since it fits perfectly in my bathroom drawer I will be purchasing another one or two.

Due to the size of the three compartments, its not the best for skinny items that tend to tip over, like gloss, mascara or brushes. It looks now certain enough to use on the counter, but isn't quite big enough to efficiently store perfume bottles.

Overall I like it and would make interdesign my new go-to brand for caddies."

Most dough would stick to it if you do not use flour (good for some doughs).  Also, it's slightly non-stick nature means you do not have to use too much flour for rolling. The mat sticks to the surface of the counter as long as the surface is clean and smooth. So, no problem with that. It is very thin and light not bulky. And it folds up easily for proper storage.

They fit perfectly in the toast over pan and work great for when you are baking items for easy clean up and non stick surfaces. They are perfect for baking cookies on or just protecting your pans from getting burnt stuck on foods on them. I really like that these fit perfectly in the pans that come with my toaster oven they are perfect for everyday use as well as just every so often.
They are very easy to clean, its like the cookies just slide off of these, I pick them up one side and they just slide off of the mat and onto your platter or others. I mean you can actually just wipe the sheets off with a cloth, I know that may sound silly but I don't ""wash"" these per say I am just worried that soap would be a little harsh for these kinds of baking mats so I just use really hot as my hands can stand water and scrub them with a wash cloth. I really love these baking mats they are great for anything that you are cooking. Oh cheese who hates baking cheese onto things? I know that I do! Because cleaning the pans are too hard to really want to do it but with these you don't have that problem with these mats the cheese comes right off with no problems.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This is a high quality product but one problem that could make is a ONE STAR purchase. I am very pleased, well made, bright chrome with a great basket strainer. After I installed the sink with strainer stopper down would not hold water, A full sink would leak out in an hour. Problem easy to solve!  The strainer has a slight tolerance defect that is easy to fix. The bottom of the strainer is slight bowed up holding the stopper too slightly too high so the water leaks out. Put the strainer on top of the open jaws of a vice and center a socket  over the stopper handle at the center of the strainer then hitting it downward. This causes the strainer bottom to now bow down a bit. This allows the O-ring to seat properly, problem solve. Yea water stayed in the sink all night. You will need to replace the O-Ring each year or worse case every 6 month. Bottom line I love this product."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"It's funny how one goes through life without having an item that when you finally get it, you wonder how in the world you lived without it! Well, that's how it is with a block plane. Being somewhat of a power tool snob, I normally don't turn to hand tools when working a project. I saw a relevant YouTube video extolling the virtues of hand planes and noticed that the master woodworker's wall was filled with planes of all sizes and shapes. It got me to wondering what I was missing. I already had a #4 plane squirreled away in my work bench, but this master craftsman convinced me that I needed a block plane. So I got this one.
Once it arrived, I did the standard ""tune up"" by getting the packing coatings removed, adjusting the blade, and sort of checking the flatness of the shoe. All was well.
I had a project going at the time with several half-lap joints where the ends extended a little proud beyond the edge. End grain! Yikes! That's not going to machine well. And I want to use a 1/4"" round over bit with my router, but before I can do that, I need to take that end grain protrusion down to flush with the other surface. Block plane to the rescue! A few quick swipes with a very light cut and it looked perfect with no breakout on the grain. I am a happy camper. I also picked up a stone and honing guide, since now I'll be using my planes a lot more. Next step is to get a few diamond honing stones in finer grits and get really serious about having insanely sharp tools."

I have had no problems with it, although it is still very heavy.  I would recommend this pan for anyone who is looking for a pan that will hold up to heavy usage, or just someone who is looking for a pan that is easy to clean, but doesn't have a lot of storage space.

They also come with a lifetime warranty so you really can not go wrong!

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,OMFG where have you been?  The only reason I didn't buy this is because I just can't get the old one to run.  The light itself is a great light and does it's job well.  The size is perfect for my needs and I like the shape of the light.  I have a few of these in
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I love my Healthy Human bottle! I have one. My husband has one. We have the metal pint glasses. It's super rare to find a company that ALL their products are really that good. And to make it better- my bottle didn't seem to keep cold when I first got it more than a regular glass did. I emailed their customer service and same day they sent me a new one and were super friendly. Awesome customer service.
Yea, 32 bucks is pricey for a water bottle but it is well made. I am terrified to bonk it against anything accidentally- it's pretty loud from the double wall and has a very loud clang it makes sounding like you broke it (it's actually really sturdy)

But it does what it says! The finish is awesome and durable, the handle is great. If you are tearing through Amazon looking for a great insulated bottle, this is it. Trust me, I did the research. This is up there with Yetis, S'well, etc. It's aweosme but way more functional."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These are *much* smaller than I expected, but they also come with their own little stand to hold the sticks while they burn.  I'll say that breaks even and give them 5 stars, because they smell great (not too overpowering)."

I have had no issues with the product, and it's going well.  I would definitely buy again.I love these lights!  I have had them for a few years now and they are awesome.  I have tried to keep them on my truck because I always feel like I'm in the middle of nowhere when I'm pulling up in my truck.  These lights are just awesome!  I've had them for a few years now and they are still great.  I love the colors and the size and the color of the light.  I can't believe I've had a few of these lights before, but I can't believe I'm buying a few of these now.  I'm not a professional carpenter so I can't speak to the"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,It works great and was extremely cheap. It is just the size that I wanted and got here quickly.  Great for corn or any kind of muffin.  Also good for cupcakes.  My daughter likes it too.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Our home has well water service and we only get about 40-45psi of water pressure.  A typical shower head gives a pretty unsatisfying experience with such mediocre pressure.  So I bought this on the hope that things would be a little better.

WOW!  I'm not sure how it works, but the end result is the feeling of significantly more pressure and a much wider and more powerful dispersal of water.  I'm going to buy additional units for the other showers in the house."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,CG,"So first the good; this saw has the quality and power of a saw that is almost as powerful.

The bad: the blade is very sharp, and the blade is very large.

The bad: the blade is very heavy and hard to hold.

The good: the blade has a decent weight and is very"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"This laundry center has streamlined and has kept the tools comfortable for a long time. I have one in my bathroom and the other in a closet. The basic design is nice and it is easy to set up and use. The carpet is very soft and the materials are excellent. The colors are great. The colors are also great. I love the fact that it is a solid color. I love the fact that it has a nice depth to it. I like that the colors are longer than the standard ones. I'm going to order another set of these for my bathroom. I'm very pleased with this purchase.A must have for every day use.  I have to get on the couch and sit on the couch, but my son can sit on the couch too.  I have a dog and my husband can sit on the couch too.  These are great for sitting on and on the couch.  I have a dog who doesn't like to stand on the couch but he loves them and they are good for him too.

I would definitely recommend these to anyone who wants a good quality vacuum, and these are a great value for the money.I bought this for my daughter to use with her headboard.  It was easy to install and did not require the use of a plastic cap.  The blade is a little long but it works great.  The brush works well and is a bit easier to use.  I am a big fan of the 2 stars because it does not make the blades slow or scald.I really like the color of this pillow.  It is soft and warm.  I haven't tried to wash it yet but"

Current review: 2 stars.
I bought a Gotham along with this one and tried them simultaneously. The Gotham was a disaster, everything stuck to it and cooked unevenly. This Copper Chef has been fantastic! It even cooks better WITHOUT oil!!! I haven't cooked much but the little I have has been wonderful. It is still new and I will update as I use it more. So far so good.

UPDATE: I rushed leaving my review... As I said, it had worked wonderfully until... I kept using it.  Now EVERYTHING sticks to it.  Disappointed and I apologize for the misleading review."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,This is a product I use everyday and it's just what I needed for my kitchen.  It is so easy to use and the attachments are easy to put together.  I love that it came with a few plates to cover a large size.I bought this to replace a broken

I had to replace a couple of pieces of plastic, so it is not that difficult to get everything to cook evenly.  The oven is also very easy to clean.  I love it.  I love the fact that I can use the preheated oven to heat up my pizza.  I have not used it for any other type of pizza, and I have not used it for other types of pizza.  I really love that it is made in the USA, and I am really happy with this pizza oven.  I would not recommend this to anyone unless you are going to have a pizza, but I hope you do.I bought this for my daughter and she loves it!  She loves"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Corelle isn't luxurious, but it's sturdy as can be.  That's why I like it so much.  Flatware doesn't leave marks on it, it doesn't chip, scratch, or crack in normal use.  I purchased this set as a gift to someone else; but my own set looks like the day I bought it perhaps six or more years ago."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Appear to be of good quality.  They are going to be exposed to winter weather so we will see how well they hold up after winter in the northeast.  For now Ill givr it 5 stars but will update if they don't hold up.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,Arrived super fast 4 days later. The shipping was quick and it was shipped in a timely manner. I bought this to replace the Schlage 32-60-8 bulb that I replaced with this one.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,Only used it a few times. The only problem is that it's not really a strong one.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Most of the reviews I've read here below 2 stars are failing to treat this blender with care. If you are making smoothies, make sure you do the following:

1) Always put liquid like nectar into the cup FIRST - very important. It should be at least 1/3 of the contents.
2) Don't stick large pieces of fruit into the container. Cut them up into 1"" or less cubes. This will make it easier to blend.
3) Do not put large ice cubes in the container. It will get stuck between the container and the blades. The blades are not big. If you push your luck too far and hit the blender button, the ice cubes will get stuck. You can burn out the motor that way, let alone break the container.
4) Do not fill the container more than 75% of the contents. That will prevent any explosion and leaking.
5) Do not press the button for long durations. Do quick presses to let the contents move around and displace itself. If you get ice cubes stuck and continue to press, you will burn out the motor.
6) Always lock the cup into the base. It is really easy to just shove it in the base and hit the button. Don't. There are icons on the cup that align with the base. Use them to avoid problems.
7) Watch the contents in the cup. If they are stuck and not moving, stop pressing the button. Take those items out and cut them into smaller sizes.
8) You will know you are pushing your luck too far when you start to smell an odor coming from the unit. Stop blending and let the motor cool down.

I've made many smoothies this way and they turn out pretty good. But just don't expect professional quality because the blades and motor are nowhere near a professional/commercial quality blender."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Lights arrived promptly and were exactly what I wanted.  The quality appears to be top notch with a heavy duty materials used.  Lights are nice a bright, but not too bright to drive your neighbors crazy.  So far so good.  Time will tell."

I have had no issues with the carpeting on it.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one to become a complete mess."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,"Very durable grout however 4/8"" wide and 4/8"" thick. I have one other other pair of the same diameter, both of these have a ""turn"" feature that makes it easier to turn them in and out. The one I have with me is the same grout and a 2/4"" diameter. I have had no problems with these since they arrived. They are just great. I have installed them all over my house and all over the yard. I have used them to replace my garage door opener. I use them to keep my garage door opener in place and to keep it from swinging out. They are perfect for the job. I would recommend these to anyone.I have been using this to replace an old 18v halogen bulb I had for a few years.  This light is pretty darn bright, with a nice soft white light.  I don't really know how I could possibly replace a halogen bulb.  But I figured I'd try it and it works great. "

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Was a house warming gift for my nephew and his wife. They LOVE it. They decided to open it and use it right away. The wine really does swirl as it is poured into the decanter aerating it more quickly than your average decanter. I'm so glad they love it and that I chose this as a gift! I will keep this in mind for other prospective gifts!
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"These felt pads are great for protecting surfaces in addition to floors.  I use them on practically everything:  kitchen chairs, small appliances, potted plants, candle holders, and so much more.  I also use them on the backs of hanging pictures to keep them from scratching the walls.  There are so many pads in this package, it will be a while before I need more.  But when I do, I will reorder these!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I had this one for about six months now, I use it almost daily, and it's perfect! I have used it for tough stuff like coffee beans, and in boiling soup, works amazing every time! Easy and comfortable to use (Some of these blenders have two buttons you need to push simultaneously! beware of those. ), easy to clean and store, I hardly ever use my fancy food processor anymore! Who wants to get that heavy clumsy thing out of the top shelf? I had other immersion blenders before but never this powerful. The only thing I would warn you about is not to pay too much for it! It's always moving between 50 and 150!

Update: So today it died off. didn't even last a year! I went to the company website to see if I can get just the motor part and it seems they're not selling those anymore at all."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"This is the second streamlight penlight I've had.  The first one suddenly stopped working  and I mailed it in to get it fixed.  It was returned and worked for awhile, then stopped working again.  I bought this second one because I like the flashlight so well, it is very bright.  However, this one has now stopped working as well, after only about 9 months or so.  I do not want the hassle of returning it for repair; will just throw it away.  It's a shame because it was a really nice flashlight while it worked.  Recently bought myself a Nitecore Tube keychain flashlight, and I really like it so far (we'll see how long IT holds up, ha) The Tube only weighs about half an ounce and it is rechargeable with a USB cable (which was not included, but the one for my basic flip phone fits)"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Arrived quickly, 2 rolls each time. The only problem is that it's not really a hinge, but a two-d row. The hinges are designed to be ""good"" and ""bad"" and it's not really a hinge. The one flaw is that the two-d rows are not a straight line. I guess it's a sign of the hinge to not come apart. Overall, I'm very happy with this product. It's an excellent product, and will be used to make your house a little nicer. I love it. I recommend it. I'm a professional and am a good customer. I love the way it works. I'll be ordering more."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,This works very well for us. We have a well and I worry about contaminates. The water tastes different after filtering. It tastes much better and cleaner. I have had well water most of my life but after moving to a different home the water did not taste good at all but this takes care of that. The water flow does slow down after about 6 weeks or so for us. We replace the filter every six to eight weeks. We have been using these for about 4 years now and will continue using.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This is a really beautiful copper cup, all copper including the handle, with a logo printed (?) on the bottom. I love hammered copper normally, but the hammering on this copper is a bit different; it is VERY regular & even, and not fully hammered but rather the hammer marks just kind of go in rows, with spaces between each one, rather than the more standard all-over hammered look.  The overall impression at first is still similar, but it does have less of a fully hammered look than I had thought. Other than that, it is still a very nice cup, and makes a great addition to my little collection of mis-matched copper cups.

Also, it does not appear to be coated with anything, so that is as-advertised - nothing to flake off into my drinks, and it 'should' oxidize normally if I want to let it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"One reviewer said it is a little too wide, but I will admit that it is a pretty sturdy piece. I had to cut a bit to get the top to be a little tighter but it worked well. It was a breeze to assemble. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great stainless steel dishwasher. I did have to make sure the lid was a little longer than intended for my purposes, but I am happy with the finish. I like that the dishwasher does not come with a sink holder. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great dishwasher.I bought this to replace a old that was broken in the middle of the night.  It was fairly easy to clean and to assemble.

It has a very nice mug holder, so I don't have to worry about it getting burned when I go to wash it.  I do wish the color was a little brighter, but it's not bad.  It's just that the mug is a bit smaller than it appears.  It would be nice"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Bought this since I needed a worklight that could run off batteries.  The unit is quite large and reasonably well built.  It gives off good enough light - not particularly very bright but bright enough to illuminate dim areas where ambient light will be available.  One thing to keep in mind that LEDs that are too bright can be a hindrance since they can be blinding reflecting off surfaces inches away where you're likely to use this thing.  Therefore this wouldn't be a great ""lantern"" in the event of a power outage, but instead provides balanced light in tight spots.  It does bend as well so can direct light optimally as you need it.  With the price in mind it's an excellent value worth every penny."

I'm sure it would be better if I put the lid on the bottom and put the lid on the top.  I would think that I would get it to be a bit thicker than I would like it to be.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,CG,"I installed this thermostat in my house and it has worked flawlessly.

The only downside is that it's very dimmable, which is annoying, but not a problem.

The thermostat is in a large, multi-function unit with an LED display. The display is a 2-way switch, so it can be switched between one mode and another if needed. I just turned on the first mode and it is on again.

This thermostat is about 30 years old, so the display is a little too large for my small apartment.

You can't really use it for that, because it's only about 10 watts.

I'm going to have to buy a second unit for my home, and the dimmer works fine.

UPDATE:  I have a very small apartment with a lot of dimmers. I installed this thermostat in the garage, and it's been working flawlessly for the past two weeks.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,May well be the best time of the year to try this.  If you have been wanting to get a top quality dish
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"So far I'm liking it. A bit larger than expected but I've never had a futon before so I had no idea what to expect. Took a bit longer to assemble than some people here stated but I must be really slow, LOL! Just have to make sure you follow the directions but otherwise no issues. Time will tell how it holds up..."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,These are just okay. They will not work to cool your room temperature or warm drink but work to keep it cool for hour or so.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Love these and I get many comments on this spoon :-)
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"It is my second Primula Espresso Coffee Maker. I should say that the quality went down significantly. The previous one had rubber gasket between upper and lower parts, this one has cheap plastic stuff which leaks when you pour the hot coffee. It is very unpleasant experience. Top portion of the maker has also deteriorated from the previous model. Hadn't I trashed the original box, I would have returned the maker after the very first use.

Ordered a rubber gasket to replace the original plastic one.

Update: the maker was returned as the quality of the product was below expectations. Rate was changed from 2 stars to 1. Not recommended for purchase."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This lock box is awesome. Very sturdy and installs easily. Not a lot of space for big keys, but it will do the trick if you need to leave a key outside and in a safe place."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"Overall, I like this product.  I love the look and feel of this pillow.  I just wish the two top sheets were different, but they're the same pillow.  I would definitely recommend this product.Love this. I am very pleased.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I bought this storage cube to put all of my knitting in next to my couch. I couldn't use the lid because my wooden knitting loom was to large. So, I use the lid as a dinner tray. Works for me.

It's a solid construction. Worth the price, for sure."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Simply put, they are fantastic.  Very happy with my purchase!  Thank you!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,Super cute because it looks nice. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the bottom
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"The color slightly different than I got,the website pictures looks better."

inner dia: 4mm
outer dia: 12mm

Somewhere down in the description it says 13 is outer dia.  Title does not match.  These need to be bought at precise matching in size.  Please fix the title/description appropriately."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"I realy liked the gun, nice and smooth work but it just broke. Description says it will not brake within a year and it did not but it broke one year and two months later after purchase. The worst part of it, is that I can NOT get parts for this gun anywhere. The ""driver"" which broke is easy to replace if you can get it, but you can not, so gun goes to the garbage and I will come back to the Hitachi which parts you can get easly and repair by yourself."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,This comes in very handy if you need to use a lightbulb in an extension cord for going underneath a house dark crawl space.

They are easy to use and carry around.  They are bright and easy to change.  I love these for our school day!  We have been using them for a couple of weeks now and love"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"didn't realize mine was coming from china, took a little over a week, so not too bad.  Not really any brighter than the 3 LED I replaced with it.  No battery compartment, guess you have to unscrew the cover if battery needs replaced."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,works well indoors not recommended.It's a very bright flashlight.  It's a little expensive but
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I am surprised at some of the reviews that consider this a small chair.  Although it doesn't feel like a 17th-century King's throne, and although it is recommended to not be used by anyone over 225 lbs, my 6'3"" 200+ lb frame fits into this chair quite comfortable, with space on either side.

This is a comfortable chair, the lumbar support is nice, the air lift works smoothly so far, and it was fairly easy to assemble (it took me 40 minutes from start to finish).  I like that the arms tilt up if you want them out of the way... of course I didn't know this when assembling it and though something was wrong!  I should also mention the metal armrests were both labeled ""J"" (instructions called one ""I"" and one ""J"") and took me awhile to figure out which is which, genius that I am.

The upholstery is a textured brownish-grey, with the metal frame kind of somewhere between a gold/nickel color.... I would think it'd be important to know this going in if your color scheme is important.

For me, the question of whether this chair is worth the $ is its longevity.  Will the upholstery pull or tear easily?  Will the up/down mechanism last?  Etc.  If I think of it I will check in here with an update in 6 months.  One wants a chair like this to last several years, of course, so, we will see.  For now, a solid 4 stars for a major upgrade over my last office chair!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"very, very thin material with some sharp edges.  I had to hide it in fear my grand daughter would cut herself on it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Extremely well packaged. Very thick outside box, then another inside box, thick cardboard protection top and bottom. On the small side but I knew that. Step for lid works very well and does not tip even when empty. Soft closing lid is nice also. Must use the plastic liner as the bottom is not solid but that is no issue for me since I wanted something that would not rust from my empty, but wet, contact lens packs. Update:  Been several months now and although it sounds foolish, this is one of my favorite items ever purchased on Amazon. The plastic liner is very simple to remove and dump and clean if needed. I do not feel a need to use a plastic bag. The lid opens and closes softly and smoothly each and every time. No need to keep your foot on the pedal to lower the lid."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I bought these drapes before I bought the pillow cases. I did not need a pillow case, but I wanted a very comfortable pillow. I also bought the pillow cases to go with my new pillow cases. They are very good quality, they are very soft and soft. I would definitely buy these again. I have a few pillows in the house and they are very comfortable."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"LOVE IT!  The vent is a little wide, but I will keep that in mind when ordering. I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it. It is very comfortable, and it is light weight. I am very pleased with the design. I have a large family, and the fact that it is a little heavier than I expected is great."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,Great product easy to install and works well.  I've installed a lot of the switches and switches
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Quick service from seller.
By far the best foam brush on the market."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I love the Blue Air product and these filter covers are awesome!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I purchased these shelves for my daughter and she loves them.  She also loves the fact that they are so small.  I am very happy with the purchase.This is a great fan. It is quiet and does not have a loud noise. I have to turn it on for the fans to work.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Really nice, exactly what I wanted. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the bottom"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This tripod for the price is good. It is short but I knew that when I bought it and then I just bought 3 pieces of  half inch steel gas pipe, 7 feet in length for about $20 from Lowes and slide them over the original tripod legs and now I have a nice tall tripod. Works great."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"It's not the rather large, bulky suction cups you'd expect from a single-brand one. It's not the dishwasher safe.  The suction cups are a bit large for the purpose of washing them.  I would prefer one for the dishwasher.  The suction cups are a bit smaller than the ones I have had in the past.  I like the size of the suction cups, but I think that they will be a"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I got this ac for my wife and she loves it.  She also loves the fact that it is so small.  I am using it for the first time in a 4x6 bed
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Not bad!  Considering how much cheaper this cutter is that the ones at the big box stores (and even here on Amazon), this is a great value.  Made cuts just like it should.  Only reason for not getting five stars is that it's aesthetically rough... there's clearly no finish work done to this item once that stamp it out and assemble it at the plant... other than a quick, shabby paint job (which, for the record is orange, not yellow as in the picture)... but again, these are all issues with the way it looks, which I could care less about... It does the job, and it's way cheaper than it's closest competitor."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,The lights were fairly easy to install and the materials are good.  The light is bright and the light output is very bright.  I also like the fact that the light output is adjustable.  I have been using this in a multi-room house with 4 bedrooms.  The light output is about 8 watts.  I also like the fact that it is a single color.  I just installed it with the wire stripper and it works great.  I would recommend this light for any home or work where the color temperature is desired.  I would also recommend this light for a small work area where it is useful for some decorative purposes.  I have bought a lot of different types of lights and this one does the job perfectly.  I have a large cabinet with a variety of LED's and this one is very useful for any of those areas.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"My son has had the same problem and the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because he doesn't like the way it looks, but that is the only reason I gave it 5 stars. It is still going strong, I am very pleased. I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Replacement for one stolen in home burglary, so exactly like that one. Does its job well. How much can you say about a pry bar?"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"My Grandsons are huge Mario & Luigi fans.  These are beautifully detailed, bold colors, soft, and comfy.  They loved them."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,Sometimes a little difficult to get the right bite.  A little uncomfortable after a couple uses.  But you rarely have to use one of these.  And a lot of fittings come with this already.  So now I have a small jar full of them.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I love how you can cut them to fit whatever size wire you are bundling.  I have an external USB port on my desk and the bundles of wire are varying in size.  These worked great.  I also was able to cut a nice small length for my headphones that I carry in my purse.  Haven't tried them on larger cable yet but found the Velcro strength more than adequate.  Would definitely purchase again and highly recommend this product.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,CG,"Mine lasted 3 weeks, then it broke and the light bulb was useless.

The only way to get a bulb that lasts 3 weeks is to get the light bulb to take 2 weeks to go off.  It takes a long time"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"When ordering don't make the mistake I did and confuse the ""radius"" description with diameter. The radius is twice the diameter. If you want a 1/4"" wide bead get a 1/8"" radius bit."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"We've all seen it...the mess in the trunk or under the seat.  For some reason wires just naturally find their way into nots, and having big heavy cable clamps on the ends doesn't help matters much.  Add to that the fact that your car won't start and your mood is deteriorating fast!  It's a recipe for disaster!  Well no longer!  Some finally invented something to save us from our frustrations.  The Arsenal cable organizer.

I bought a set of 25' Coleman 4ga Booster Cables with it and they fit without a problem!  So just about any jumper cable size and length combo should prove to work as well.  There are two sleve style compartments on the sides.  Good perhaps for a set of flat tools such as a wrench or plyers or good for gloves.  The stiching on the handles is top to bottom so I don't fear those coming loose.  The zippers are good heavy stock so they should last as well.

One more word of advice save the twist ties that come with your cables, and if they don't come with them get some.  Twist tying them before storage will help the bag keep them nice, neat, and flat.  And the bag will keep those monster clamps from hooking everything around them!

Update: I just bought a second bag and a set of Coleman 25' 2ga cables.  They fit great!  So buy this bag with confidence for just about any cable size and length combo you can find!!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I would have said I love it, but gosh, it's just a pitcher.  On the other hand, it's a better pitcher than I have had in a long time.  Its narrow profile and non-spill lid are great in the refrigerator.  I made concentrated orange juice in it recently and was able to shake the container without spilling a drop; that's not something every pitcher can say.  I was disappointed that it was plastic, but I guess it could be uncomfortably heavy if it weren't.  And the best part of all: it's made in the United States.  Since I'm trying to stay away from any products that will be used for food made in China, that is recommendation enough."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Easy to install, comfortable and stable wide grip, larger plate makes keeping router flat on the workpiece easier. Very happy with purchase."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I've had this for almost two years and it's still running on the original batteries (and they're cheapies).
It's kept the time and date perfectly.
Update: 11/20/17
I noticed the display was a little dim.
I changed the batteries and it's nice and dark again not to mention it set itself within 5 minutes.
I got a little under 3 years from a set of cheap Sunbeam AA batteries.
One battery still tests good and one was starting to leak which is probably why the display was getting dim.
The clock is still accurate in time and date so I'd call this a great purchase."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Yes, I do like this little pitcher, but it is too small.  It doesn't hold a lot of liquid, and I am not sure how the plastic part would hold it up to it's weight.  I would like a bit more space for it to hold up to the heavier stuff.  I have a few sizes, but none"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,It's bigger than I thought it would be. But it arrived quickly and did the job.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"The colors of medtainers are really great, the green is bright and cheerful, your eye gets drawn to it. I also have a blue one which can be harder to find but it's a very calming bright blue. They are solid and contain smell pretty decently. The grinder works pretty well too. The pictures make them seem a little bigger than they actually are, they are a little bigger than an rx pill bottle. Plenty of storage but still compact and convenient, very good size imo."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Not the best shoe storage container I've had, but it works. The fabric is a bit thin, and I feel that my heels will eventually poke through it. There isn't much support and mind definitely doesn't stand up stiff like the one shown in the picture. This would be perfect for child shoes, or for flats. Tennis shoes and heels do not fit together in one slot. They take up two because of how small the slots are. That being said, I put my expensive shoes in this container so that they don't get ruined or dirty by other things in my closet or by other shoes touching them. I keep it in my closet as it doesn't fit under the style bed frame I have, and it works wonderfully to keep them clean and organized. The zipper is strong, and the plastic top allows me to see what I have in the bag without having to open it and look through. I received this product at no cost in exchange for my honest review."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I bought this piece to put in my dining room and to pull together all the colors of my kitchen and living room and it did just the trick! Love this piece!
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Innovative design. I feel that it offers the best combination of gripping strength and openability that I have seen in a long-reach plier. The best part of the double X is that it allows the jaws to open wide while the shank stays relatively thin, which is key for areas you will be using this plier (restricted access).

I hate sloppy pliers. I feel that this plier has a low level of slop in the joints. Which is impressive considering that it has twice as many joints as a conventional plier.

Apex tool group makes these and sells them under both Gearwrench and Crescent brands. Pick you favorite color of handle."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Folks, I have to tell you that this product is the most freaking great items in modern history!!  And I am not kidding. It is right up there in love with my picture with Nathan Fillion of Firefly Fame. (He was my Captain before he was that Castle guy).  It is so good I am blown away.

I have tested it like you would not believe and it is all you say plus a bag of Cheetos!!! I love to slow sip especially in the summer.  And I want you to know that I bought an iced venti green tea lemonade, two pumps  at 10:10 in my 30 ouncer (perfect size for a venti) Beast.  It took me through my shift at the Genealogy Library 11:00 to 2:00. still cold and still about half.  Got home and got totally side tracked. When I got back to the front room where I had put it on my coffee table, it was 6:20 and it was still as cold as when I put the green tea lemonade in it at 10:00.

I have two dear friends that are genealogists too, and I am getting them each a 30 ounce Beast for Christmas, because it is totally indispensable!  You folks are Brilliant for developing it and though you cannot see me, I am bowing wildly before you!

A Devoted fan or your Beast.  (now if you could come up with sheets for the bed that keep everything that cool for summer a million women with hot flashes will surely elevate you to Gods!!!!

From the bottom of my heart, Thank You!!!!!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I read all the reviews of this item. I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical about buying them. I just made Low Carb Pumpkin Bread in my new large bread pan. It turned out awesome and removing it from the pan was very easy. I didn't grease the pan in any way. These pans are not flimsy, definitely non-stick and stacking them is not an issue because they bend in whatever direction you need them to. I'm very happy."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Light when I need it, or when an unexpected visitor comes, but I didn't turn on the light by the door."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"They are durable.  Made in China and the materials are good.  These work well and look great.  Great price!Works great.  The light is a little brighter than it should be.  It's not a large beam, but it is very bright."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I use this switch to turn on blue led strip lighting in my garage.  I have it set up so whenever the opener light is on, this switch is on.  It really helps light up the garage when i enter and leave.  Plus its really cool that i can control this switch from my phone with the myQ app."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Good sturdy rug suitable for use in a beach house or where there is heavy traffic & dirt. It has a natural rustic appeal & can be cleaned by being shaken out. It works very well in my heavily used hallway.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,Very nice. Good quality for the price. Look forward to giving as a wedding gift & feel certain new bride & groom will like it.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"As far as shower heads go this one works well.  I replaced just a stock circular shower head, and I would say this has as much water pressure as before, enough to get the shampoo and what not out of your hair, however, I do switch on the 'full blast' setting when rinsing my hair just to give it a reason for existing.  I'm concerned about other reviews that say the toggle for this setting will eventually blow out within 6-12 months.  I guess we'll see.  It won't be the end of the world as I'll then get to test some of the other shower heads I was looking at before deciding on this one :D.

I'm giving the product 4 stars instead of 5 just because as stated in another review, the design is a waste.  It's a wider spray, which I like, but the curved aspect of it is totally pointless.  They adjusted the nozzles inwards so that despite the curved designed, that would otherwise spray your whole body (making the head pretty awesome), it all just sprays straight like a normal flat head would.  The curved design is aesthetic only, and therefore doesn't make any sense to me.  I think it is wasted potential and somewhat misleading."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"One day I accidentally dropped it on the ground and it was all over my workbench.  I wasn't sure if it would be a good idea to put it in a trash can or not.  It's in a large storage box.  I was worried it might not be the best idea to put it in the trash, but it is the best I've found.  I love the fact that it has a nice rubber grip on it.  It's very easy to open it.  I've used it on my bench, too, and it works great!  I'm glad I found it.I have used this for a couple of months now.  It is very easy to install and does a good job.  It is a bit pricey and I had to go with a brand new one.  However, the metal screws are a nice feature.  I don't really like the mounting hardware but I will probably get a good one for the kitchen.  This is a great tool for the price.  I would definitely recommend it.I received this product at a discount on Amazon, at a discount on Amazon Prime.

I used it to make a jewelry holder for my sister and really needed something thicker. If you are using this, just know that it is more low profile, which is PERFECT for tight spaces. It was super cute painted, but looked really nice before hand/natural too."

Now by illuminate I don't mean everyone will be reading books by this light, although if you sat close you could - I mean that it was a soft illumination for the entire room.  I didn't remove the protective pad for the magnet so didn't use that feature.  It's expensive, but oh so worth it.  Provided much more usable lighting than our traditional Stanley flashlight.  I had neighbors ask me why our house looked so lit up and I got to brag on this flashlight.  Hope they get more sales as it's so useful in a power outage, and heaven forbid you are in a dangerous situation it has a very strong clip to clip to your belt/jacket/whatever."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"Bidets are awesome so this review is not a statement of the usefulness of a bidet.  Those of us who have visited Japan come back with an attitude of ""what have I been thinking trying to clean myself with a dry tissue?""  When you find a good bidet you'll never want to use anything else.

I took off one star for each of the three problems I found with this product:

Problem #1:  The product fit the mounting holes fine, as the pre-measurement assured it would.  The problem was the how the seat closed.  The back of our existing toilet seat interfered slightly with the top of the bidet.  This bent the nozzle back out of vertical position, causing the water stream out between users legs and onto the floor.  There was no mention in product description of pre-measuring the seat for this issue.

Problem #2:  There is no pressure adjustment.  Our house is new construction so the water pressure is great, about 75 psi.  Ouch.  Yes I can open the valve slightly to compensate but the valve is sensitive so there were many ouch moments.

Problem #3:  As you see from many other comments, the bidet causes a big gap in the front of the toilet seat.  Options are to ignore this (I think most positive reviewers are doing this), buy shims to fill the gap, or....buy a different product.  I built a nice house and it looks quite unprofessional to have a toilet seat with a 2-3"" gap in the front.  The gap on our toilet seat was greater than other reviewers due to problem #1 (see pic)."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Just received this yesterday and tried the recipe that came with it today. Easy and delicious. Pan cleaned up almost by itself. I highly recommend this product.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"I found the Blair (BLR13224) 3/8 in. Double End Spotweld Cutters to be very aggressive. The first one bit in, snapped one of the four teeth right off. I have no clue what broke it. The second one worked for a minute or so and then did the same. So far the third one is going and cut and removed about two dozen spot welds, but is noticeably becoming worn down. The initial aggressiveness has worn off.

For the money... I have found better spot weld bits and will most likely not reorder these as they definitely don't last as I expected. Sorry, but facts are facts. I'm not that impressed. As I mentioned in the review under ""Blair (BLR13224) 3/8 in. Double End Spotweld Cutter in Blister Pack"", the bits were extremely difficult to remove remove from the #13216 Arbor/Retractable Pilot threaded shaft. I had to resort to putting the arbor into a vice, clamping it down, TIGHT, and removing the bit with a pair of vice grips. The threads are common right handed threads so there should be no doubt one would remove the bit in a left handed motion. Every time I removed a bit, same thing. This is caused by the right handed direction the bit turns when removing spot welds. Understandable, but they really become torqued in place.

Sorry for the negative review, but Facts are Facts! When they cut, they cut. But why make this kind of work more difficult than it needs to be. At the cost??? Well, I'll let you be the judge."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I installed this faucet on my garage sink because of its constant use and the profile of the vertical position of the filter.  Installation is a snap and simple.  I did it with no problem and that's a bundle to say.  I waited this long to be sure the filter worked and the unit had the longevity that I expected and with each issue the unit is flawless.  My water comes directly out of the ground in the back yard, goes through about 400 feet of pumping and then another 200 feet of pipe to get it into the house before it goes into the water holder.  Whew, what a trip.  No wonder it takes rainwater over 6 months to seep down to the water level.  After the water comes into the holding system it is then sent into the house pipes upon demand.  It goes through a wound cord filter and then a charcoal filter before it finds its way to the PUR-3.  I know that's a long route and story but I wanted to be sure I gave the facts as best I could.  The PUR-3 did it's job.  It provided me with as clean a water as I could ask for.  No, it is not distilled water but it is close.  I checked it for obvious solids and other discolorations and it was as clean as I could expect because I found not the first foreign item.

I considered giving this a 5 star and did not because the amount of water coming out the faucet is significantly less than the water coming out of an unfiltered tap.  That reduced my use of the faucet from time to time such as washing the dogs or preparing water for use in cleaning paint brushes.  Removal and remounting the faucet is as easy as can be and is not an issue.  I recommend this unit without any exception and the water flow is more my problem then that of PUR.  Good drinking."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I really like this Wine Rack.  It's comfortable and it's easy to clean.  It is so easy to open the lid.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I bought this for the room that my cats litter pan is in. The filter that came with the fan worked but I wanted to see if this would do any better. I was very surprised at the difference. Within about a hour the room was the freshest in the house. The room is 12x14 and there is a noticeable difference even in the adjoining rooms. I think even the cat has noticed.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Exactly what it claims to do - they are well constructed and have served us well. We got tired of using those disposable chopsticks that come with take-out and having to ensure that there were no extraneous ""splinters"". Because of its construction, as well as it's material, it is a great set of chopsticks for people to learn with, unlike the slippery plastic / resin / metal versions. In fact, I like these chopsticks more than other fancier sets that I own just because they are easier to use and hold food better. They hold up well in the dishwasher and for my money, it's a great value."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"It's small (under 2"" side to side) including the diffuser and just over 1"" for the light part. Sure it puts out heat but the diffuser reduces it somewhat and after all it is for halogen lamps.  I have only seen hot ones.  For me, it serves a special purpose by lighting that small area I use for tedious work such as watch repair and fine soldering on tiny electrical things (the scientific word defined as stuff).

While I really like the bulb I wish the company had included instructions and other elements about the life and uses just in case there would be other uses or functions that I have yet to encounter.  About the only extra information included is that the lamp is dimmable and it has a 3 year 25,000 hour warranty.  If it were to break in less than 3 years I would not know what to do.  The most important element in this lamp is that it is LED and that makes up for a bunch of missing information."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I recently lost my Contigo mug like this and started using a random back-up mug I already had laying around the kitchen. After a few days, I noticed that I'd finished my coffee hours earlier than usual every single morning with the back-up mug. Normally I sip on my coffee until it's nearly lunchtime, but now I was finishing it on my morning commute.

The next morning I was thinking about this and realized exactly what the cause was: My Contigo mug kept my coffee so hot that I could not take big gulps of it and it took me until 11 am to get through it. The back-up mug cooled so quickly that I was gulping my coffee by the time I got in the car.

After less than a week I ordered a new Contigo and I will be a customer for life now.

This mug will keep your coffee pipingly, tongue-burningly hot for hours when sealed. Like others have said, I actually leave the lid off for a couple of minutes after I pour and blow on it to bring it down to a drinkable temperature because I know once I seal the lid it's staying that hot. The more of the coffee you drink the more it will start to lose its heat (because you're replacing hot coffee with room-temperature air with every sip, which is cooling the remaining coffee). But the cooling happens slowly enough that the only time the liquid inside of it really gets *cold* is when the cup is less than half full and the snap lid is open, which is letting a lot of air circulate inside the cup. If you leave it full, it will stay *hot*--not warm--for 7 hours."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is really a beautiful set of high quality knives that I anticipate lasting a long time.  The come from the factory razor sharp and over the limited time I have used them have show no signs of wear.  The set features a nice variety of knives from a small paring knife all the way up to a good size butcher's knife.  All feature excellent balance and enough weight to feel serious and comfortable without being clumsy.  Moreover, the handles are nicely positioned relative to the blade, which makes chopping both easier and safer.  I will say that in particular I liked the serrated carving knife, something you don't typically see in this size set.  I happened to be cooking a roast the day the knives arrived, and the carving knife made short, clean work of it.

It would be nice if there was an option to receive a block instead of a magnet rack; I'm not opposed to the latter, but I don't happen to have a convenient place to hang it which is going to make storing these knives a small, but worthwhile challenge.  In short I would say that these are high quality knives, and for the price point, a solid investment."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"UPDATE Mar-2016:  I bought a second one for myself.  Overall, it seems fine, and I like the size of the teapot, but the design allows the last drop of every pour to run down the spout.  Buy the time we are done drinking tea, there is a stain at the bottom of the spout.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I bought this teapot for my sister who has been looking for a large teapot for a long time.  This is a nice size teapot that is large enough to serve a party of 6+ people.  With a normal teacup being about 6 oz, the teapot holds about 12 teacups.

I like the plain white classic design as it would go with anything.  The overall quality seems to be very good, although the empty teapot weighs less than I imagined it would just by looking at it.  The small loop handle in the front is very helpful for serving because the full tea pot is quite heavy.

One of the pictures of the white teapot shows a lid open that seems to have a built in brewing vessel, however, the teapot I have received has a plain lid.  Not a big deal for me, but something I feel others should be aware of.

UPDATE: After about a year of regular use the teapot is still holding up well and nothing broke or cracked.  My sister is very happy."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Great fluffy waffles! Clean up isn't as easy as the standard one I had. The mouth of the iron is made of a plastic that batter STICKS & HARDENS! It's not what I was accustomed to with my other waffle iron that was constructed with all non stick materials. If you don't clean it while it's still warm, you'll be scraping it & the crumbs will fall inside the iron. It does take less space. The measuring cup doesn't have a spout so it's messy to use while aiming for the mouth. I found that our recipe needs 3/4 of the cup since the batter rises. If you have any OCD tendencies, the excess baked in the mouth might be bothersome. (I would have no trouble eating the excess, but my husband cuts off the excess &throws it away! So far I estimate that he has thrown away 1/4 waffle for every 6 waffles he has made...so the batter won't make as many as before. still looking for the appropriate measure).

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Ignoring common sense and warnings on the Web, I bought one of these hand held Dyson DC34 vacuums for about 4 times what I'd pay for a high end competitor's model (e.g. Black and Decker LiIon model). When I got it, I was initially very pleased: Good suction, worked very well. The battery life is short (maybe 6-7 minutes on a charge), but I knew that going in, and that's just part of the package.

Then, after a number of months, the machine began stopping after a few seconds. It wasn't that the battery wasn't charged: I could use it for a few seconds, have it stop, play games with the unit, get it to run for maybe 20-30 second, have it stop, play more games, and so on to get the full 5-6 minutes out of it. But the unit just failed to run continuously for more than a fraction of a minute. I went online and discovered this is a horribly common problem with this model. I contacted Dyson and had them tell me that the unit was out of its (short) warranty and that I'd need to buy another one.

That's not going to happen. Instead, I'll try to warn you all not to waste your money on this machine that, apparently, has design defects. Instead, get a high end (LiION battery) Black & Decker, or similar model for a quarter of the price. It might not be 100% as good as a vacuum, but it's assuredly 90% as good, and in addition, you'll get a much longer lifetime out of it. And when it dies, you can buy another THREE before you're up to the cost of this piece of poorly designed junk.

It's very easy to use and the quick release action makes it very easy to use.  This drill is super fast and easy to use.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"The first Bissell Pet Hair Remover purchase was for my mother's home.  There were 3 dogs (2 Great Danes and a 40 lb mutt), and 4 cats.  There is carpeting throughout most of the house, and on all 27 (sigh) stairs.  This thing got the stairs cleaner than I thought possible.  We've brought them back to looking brand new - not to mention the work it did on the furniture.  So, when I moved into a house with all hardwood floors but carpeted stairs (wait..what?), and two dogs...I knew what I had to do!  I have a Great Dane, and a Terrier style mutt.  Lots of blonde and white hair is attracted to those stairs.  This thing made them brand spanking new in minutes.  The suction is great - I am continually shocked that it is so powerful.  The front end tool is fantastic.  I can't say enough about this thing.  I highly recommend it!!"

Not only is this a smart looking very serviceable bright desk lamp with adjustable brightness but it also provides the capacity to charge mobile phones in times of power outages (or high electricity bills!) because it is powered by solar energy.

It may be small in design but it is big in Eco-friendly usage and the light it provides is amazingly bright. These devices such the one SUNNYTECH has designed are the wave of the future. It is a fine investment for many reasons. Grady Harp, August 14"

To get it to grind, I have to constantly shake the unit while grinding so that the blades are grinding coffee beans versus air. The dial is so loose for the grind grading, that just touching it could shift it. Same with the timer. Don't accidentally touch it because the time will shift. Finally, there is ground coffee all over the counter-top every day because the cup is so static that there is coffee in and out of the cup. I don't usually write reviews much, much less bad one. But this was a waste of money.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I've had this rack for 18 months and it is fantastic!  My old rack (bought at Linens & Things) rusted after about 5 years and I replaced it with this one, which is larger and stronger than the original.  I do not use the cup rack because we use the bottom portion for those items.  My silverware rack did not come with a plastic drip catcher  but usually by the time I am through washing dishes the silverware is no longer dripping and I just wipe under the end of the rack when I give the rest of the counters a wipe down.

No issues with rust so far...........I can only think that the chrome was not applied properly on those that rusted in a short period or time OR the racks were literally standing in water for extended periods.  Nothing lasts forever and especially these items that are manufacturered with a short life expectancy.  If I get five years out of it it will be worth the money I spent for it.

I would buy this rack again and have recommended it to others who have purchased it and like it also."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Home automation seems to be one of the biggest raves talked about in today's electronic industry. Unfortunately, it has not yet reached a point where it is affordable enough for people on limited budgets. Enter this magnificent product. This product comes with the three receivers and one remote. The receivers are pretty large - they plug directly into an outlet and then you plug something into the receiver. I would not recommend using these on a power strip as they will cover at least two outlets and take up too much space. I use these primarily for light fixtures and fans. It's nice to not have to go in awkward places to turn devices on - instead, you just push a button on the remote. Although they are overall convenient and a great idea, the size of the receivers and the limited reception of the receivers from the remote signal (which can be blocked by thick walls or dense objects) can be a major downside. However, if you are only using these in one room, you should be fine. That being said, I would still recommend these. Jump into the future of technology with some indoor wireless outlet controllers. They're fun and affordable and can save you lots of time bending over to turn things on."

Some may prefer the 2L, but I love the size and weight for a setup not requiring an extended burn time for (ie. home defense).  It mounts very well with the Magpul MLOK Offset mount.  I did make one small modification that would be nice to see from the factory as an option.  I (very carefully) drilled out the existing screw holes to accommodate the mlok size screws so that I could directly attach it extremely securely to my MI handguard.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I got this item on Thanksgiving/Black Friday this year with a sale they were having, so for the sale price of $64 it was a great deal.  I had gone back and forth for a while about whether I was going to switch to this type of coffee maker from my traditional 4 cup coffee pot I had used for years, mainly due to the expense and the taste of some of the pods.  I ordered the filter/pod assembly where you can use your own coffee grinds as well (figured that would save on expense). One thing I did decide to do (which I am glad about) is to get this model because it has the water reservoir that holds quite a bit of extra water.  I am really happy about that.  The coffee maker came quickly and I have used it now for about a month.  It took some trial and error with the grinds and the type to use in the filter but I finally have that down pretty good.  I ended up looking for my favorite brand of pods as well that were on sale, so most of the time I use the filter and my own coffee, but then every few cups I go with a pod.  That saves some money too.  I do think this whole style of coffee maker uses way more coffee than the normal brewer, however that being said - the convenience of the one cup and how hot it comes out, I actually don't think I would ever go back to the traditional pot, and that is saying a lot - because like I said I fought this switch for a while.  All in all I am extremely happy with this product and am glad I bought it and switched over."

Secondly, while all the parts works fine, it lacks one crucial component for apple stuff repairs: A plastic pryer. The tweezer coming along with it is definitely the worst in its class and useless for prying anything. To have to triangular pryers makes no sense.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Received shoe rack in a reasonable amount of time.  Assembly is easy enough (15-20 minutes).  Shoe rack is stable.

The finish of the metal tubing is nice aesthetically. The plastic connectors work well, but look a bit cheap and may also remind you of children's connecter toys.

My biggest issue with the rack itself is the shelving material.  It resembles black weed control paper you'd put under mulch, with a thin plastic layer on top.  Will it hold shoes and be pretty easy to clean, yes I think so.  Is it a durable material....No.  If you think this rack will receive any amount of abuse or rough handling, I might look elsewhere.

Now to the sellers service:
My rack was missing four tubes needed to complete assembly.  I contacted the seller and the following was our (abridged) discourse.

Seller:. Can you please take a picture of missing pieces and send (via email) so we can verify what is needed.

Me: Pictures sent

Seller: These components are out of stock.  Can you buy them elsewhere and we will reimburse you?

Me: That is unacceptable.  You are the manufacturer of these components. Open another box if need be, and please send me what is needed to complete the shoe rack you sold me.

Seller: components are out of stock, we are issuing you a refund.

Ultimately, I felt like they were trying to get me to drop my request by making things less straight forward than they should have been, but I don't know that for sure, and I do appreciate that in the end they rectified the situation.

Take this for what it's worth.  It's a utility shoe rack and the seller is responsive and NOT in the business of cheating customers."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"The box is not deep enough, large envelopes and magazines don't drop in the box, you have to pull down the handle to make it drop. The outgoing mail clip is made for #10 business envelopes and slightly larger, if you put a greeting card in there it is visible from the outside. The clip should be mounted on the side of the pull down drawer rather than the bottom to allow you to put larger envelopes in. The box comes with 12 1/2"" holes drilled in the bottom to allow for various mounting configurations, you are only going to use 4. The box should come with 12 plastic plugs to fill the holes not used. Mail boxes sit just 8"" from the curb which very often has water running in it. When the mail truck arrives he can very easily splash water into the mail box from the bottom. The locking door has a gap between it and the mailbox, very easy to insert a small crow bar and pry it open. Information with the box states for extra keys both blank and cut can be ordered online. Not true, you have to call the company for cut keys."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this LED CRLight 4W Dimmable LED Filament Candle Light Bulb,2700K Warm White 400LM, E12 Candelabra Base Lamp C35 Bullet Top, Clear Glass Cover, 40W Incandescent Replacement light!  This 4 Watt is exactly what I've been looking for and an amazing light bulb! The placement of where we use this light is in our bedroom fan light. I feel so much better knowing that we are only using much less power instead of full 40 wattage of an incandescent bulb.

I have attached several pictures for comparison between the original style light bulb and this E12 base dimmable candelabra bulb. The first picture shows the size comparison between the 40W incandescent light bulb and this 4W LED candle light bulb (practically the same size). They have the same E12 base size and these light bulbs are for light fixtures such as chandeliers, fans, etc (not for tiny night lights). The construction and quality of the light bulb is so sturdy and excellent. The other picture shows how the LED light bulb glows and puts off a ton of light. This particular bulb is a Warm White which is my favorite and preferred choice of light bulb color. Ive come to realize the Bright White bulbs look too blue for my taste and the Warm yellow looks too much like my grandmas house. So my preference is in the middle at the warm white.

I tested the dimmable feature of these light bulbs as our fans have dimmable remotes to control the light. There is no flicker in the bulb at all and looks like a normal bulb when dimming. I think having the LED light with the characteristic of being dimmable is a huge plus since our fan has a remote with a dimmer switch and it works like a charm. I like the option to dim whenever I want to. I wish I would have bought this light sooner and started saving my energy bills!

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"This is a very good LED lamp for the price. Most people will find the light a bit harsh and the range of color temperatures a bit arbitrary. People who like to fiddle with stuff will enjoy this lamp. Let me list the pros and cons.

Pros:
The lamp is lightweight and seems pretty sturdy and stable on the base.
The light is very steady and there is no flicker.
The controls are easy to learn and access.
The finish is nice.
The lamp head is long enough for most desktop applications.
The lamp head can be pivoted and tilted to a wide range of angles.
The head can be pointed backward to bounce the light off the wall for an indirect lighting effect.

Cons:
The lamp head can only be rotated 45 degrees left and right on the base.
The two middle color temperatures are quite similar and the whitest temperature is very harsh and almost bluish.
The lamp uses a power block instead of a direct plug in.
The styling of the lamp probably won't fit with most desk styles. It is sort of  nouveu but also sort of sharp angled.

I will be using the lamp for some photographic work and it is very good for setting white balance and exposure for close ups. My camera can really tell the difference in the colors, and the range of dimming is very wide. I am not sure whether the lamp has any eye protecting value as stated, or not. But at least you never have to change a light bulb!
Good value for money and a recommended product."

Update: Did anyone ask for an update on this throw pillow? Who can know. But I wanted to say that this pillow is so scratchy that it is pretty much unusable and I'm probably going to get rid of it. I am angry at the pillow but in a larger sense I am angry at myself for letting me underestimate my

Instructions are weak... not terrible, but I had trouble understanding a few things and kept re-reading - was not as clear as could be on how to thread the nylon string through the pulleys... I also wish it had adjustable mounts to accomodate angled ceilings better. It would be nice, too, if bracket mounts were made to screw into 2x4 ceiling joists.

If you have a solid ceiling, especially a flat ceiling, these will be easy to install, if you have a high open ceiling, especially with steep angle, it will require more work and improvising... but once installed, keeps my bike up out of the way."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"Considering how ancient the unit was that this replaced, a life of 2 years was a disappointment.  The company that installed it for Loews didn't repair them so we called another service.  The following is what I was told and I have no way of verifying if this was the straight scoop or BS.  The circuit control board was bad.  Probably for the following reason:  the track for the chain was in sections and vibrated when the door opened or closed and this transmitted to the motor unit and caused the board to fail.  The choices were: either order a new board, wait for it to arrive and pay for a second service call, or install a new unit.  We bought a new Guardian Model 628 with belt drive and a solid track that the tech just happened to have on the truck.  The technician pointed out that the door rollers were solid plastic and the black marks on the door tracks were where the plastic skidded and didn't roll and he had teflon rollers with ball bearings that were much better.  Several hundred dollars later I have to say 1) the belt drive unit is much smoother than the chain drive, and 2) the door, when pushed by hand, goes up and down with much less effort due to the ball bearing rollers.  I have no idea if what the tech explained to me was true, but the result is very good, if pricey.  None of this was expressed when I bought the unit so you might ask about chain drive vs belt drive - at the time I was told it was a question of noise, but no question the belt drive is smoother.  I was not offered a choice of ball bearings on the door rollers and I do think that bearing rollers are a good option if they offer it."

The entire system is not inexpensive because the purifier is expensive and the replacement filters seem relatively expensive.

However, the performance is valuable for anyone with allergies. By the time my filters are changed, there is noticeable build-up of particles so I know that this is something that we would be breathing in if not for the purifier.

When I think about what our purifier does, running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for 365 days a year, I am appreciative for our cleaner air and decreases allergy reactions. The cost of the filter, changed twice a year, is approximately $0.45/day. For me, and my family, this is a good deal!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Okay, I actually have one of these, was given as a gift at xmas.  It works fine, the machine is crazy simple (nothing electric, just a lever) and the CO2 cartridge is very easy to install and remove.  Because the person giving the gift bought them I have two bottles and two of the 4oz cartridges.  I personally get 11 liters from the 4oz charge (I've been keeping track to see and that's been pretty consistent).

At the moment you can at least go to Bed Bath and Beyond stores and EXCHANGE the small cartridge for $10 (buying an extra filled one off the shelf costs $20).  You just go to the cashier/service desk there and they'll have a box of refilled ones behind the counter that they'll swap with you and charge $9.99.

But they promise 16oz cartridges as an option and I have yet to find these available anywhere.  Just thinking as reading this I should contact Cuisinart and ask where I can get one.  For heavy use you probably don't want to buy one of these for yourself at least until the 16oz cartridges are reasonably available and able to be exchanged at the lower price.  I wouldn't expect to ever come out ahead on cost even with with the larger cartridge.  I mean, I can buy some bottles of plain seltzer (which is mainly what I'm making) for about 70 cents a liter.  You can get some CO2 less than that but can't get it low enough to recoup the cost of the machine I don't think.  it IS a space saver though if you're a heavy user of fizzy beverage products.  If I exchange one CO2 cartridge while the other still has some charge then I basically never run out yet only have two bottles taking space in the fridge.  Plus I'm not going through a ton of disposable bottles.  That's worth something I guess."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Best machine for the money! This is our second Magnifica Super Automatic.  Our previous machine finally stopped being perfect after eight years of daily use (usually three or four uses per day).  The amount of money this machine has saved us over the past eight years is astonishing.  I prefer my homemade lattes to coffee shop lattes by a long shot.  Our guests always remember how fabulous our coffee is and request it if we don't offer!

It is absolutely super automatic.  You do have to clean it and add water after five or six double shots, but it is simple to do so.  You have to dump out the grinds from an easily removed container, pour out the excess water in the drip pan and fill up the water reservoir.  It usually takes about three minutes, tops, to complete this.  Once per month I gently wipe down the interior with a damp cloth and remove the grinder for a more thorough clean.  That process is about 5 minutes to complete.  The descaling happens once every four months or so (we have soft water so it doesn't get a lot of scale build up) and takes less than 30 minutes for the machine to do its thing.  Other than that, you just add beans and enjoy fabulous coffee.  Simple!  Simple!  Simple!

I was delighted that DeLonghi offered virtually the same machine now as it did eight years ago.  If it isn't broken, don't fix it!  We unpacked the box, followed the brief set up instructions and within 15 minutes were enjoying an excellent latte.

I can't recommend this machine enough for coffee lovers. It makes the best espresso shots anywhere (we love Lavazza espresso http://www.amazon.com/Lavazza-Super-Espresso-Coffee-2-2-Pound/dp/B000SDKDM4/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1419869268&sr=1-2&keywords=lavazza+expresso), is easy to use and clean, and is a fabulous value.  You won't want to buy a latte at a coffee shop again."

This is a very well made and well made piece of equipment.  This is an excellent product and should be of a higher quality than the expensive ones I have had.  If you are looking for something that is just as well made and well made as the cheaper ones I have had, this is the tool for you.  It works well, but I am disappointed with the quality of the finish.  The only thing I would say is that the finish is not exactly what I was expecting.  The only reason I would give this 5 stars is that the materials are not exactly what I was expecting.  The material is a little hard to grip, but I'm happy with the grip.  I don't really like the mounting hardware, but I do like that it works.  I bought a couple of TELUS pieces for my kitchen cabinets and they are very well made.  The only complaint I have is that the ""lock-out"" knob is very small and I can't get it to lock into place.  I have a nice"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"There is something to these Himalayan salt lamps. This is the second one I have purchased. When I purchased the first one, I wasn't expecting anything but a cute night light. We normally keep them on all day, until we go to bed. The first thing we noticed was that is seems to attract our pups. They've never tried to eat it or anything crazy. They just want to lay next to it, usually with their heads very close to it. Then I noticed my husband turned it on as soon as he got home every evening. He isn't into hokey gimmicks that may or may not have healing powers or whatever. I'm convinced that there is SOMETHING to this rock! We call them our Zen Rocks :) Maybe the amber glow is relaxing, maybe it's more. When they are not turned on, the pups don't spend much time on that side of our couch. When they aren't on, I keep thinking, I need to get off my lazy behind and turn them on, like they're calling for me ;) I LOVE OUR ZEN ROCKS!

In comparison with the other one I purchased, the color is pretty much the same. They both have a wood base and you insert the bulb into the bottom. They are both a bit oddly shaped and imperfect, which I love. This lamp doesn't have a simple on or off switch. You can turn it all the way on or only light it dimly. The reason I didn't give this lamp five stars is because it arrived in a squished box. I kept my finger crossed, but my heart sunk when I realized that the switch had a big crack in it. Luckily it works despite the crack. I wish it had been wrapped better."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I purchased this Relaxing Sofa Bean Bag Folding Sofa Chair, Futon Chair & Lounge in white by E-joy and I really like it so far. I ordered it on the 10th and it was delivered on the 17th, so that's pretty good free shipping in my opinion. I was worried I'd have to wait weeks for it, but it arrived in good time and in perfect condition. It comes folded over and has a little belt and clip that holds it closed. Once removed, in unfurled and I was glad it see it looked just like in the picture, a nice cream color, but mine did come with two pillows not one. It did have a slight chemical factory smell, but I've been letting it air out in the living room with all of the windows opened and that's helped already. My only complaint is that the different positions of the recliner don't really click into place. Like, you can hear the click when it's in position, but when I lean back on it, it just goes to the farthest back setting, so it's not really adjustable unless you have it pushed back against a wall to hold it in place. It is really comfortable though and I can definitely see myself taking naps on this in the very near future.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I'm giving this 5 stars, even though I clearly received a different color than the one in the product image. The product is described as and pictured as *black with gold"", but I received blue with gold. and it's still lovely. I've attached a couple of closeups below, where you can clearly see the royal blue against the gold. The teacup arrives in an almost impenetrable fortress of styrofoam and bubblewrap. You could drop it off the roof and it would be fine. The porcelain is almost unbearably delicate. I was worried my hamfists would shatter it just by moving it around to take the photos. The teacup is the most delicate piece. When you hold it up to the light, you can see a translucence---it's really lovely. The gold trim is very attractive. My set actually has more gold trim than pictured in the product images. Specifically, my teacup has a handle that is almost entirely gold, and the small teaspoon actually has some gold detailing at the end of the handle. (See photos. )

I only have a single place setting right now, and I imagine that the confusion over color (black vs blue) might make it more difficult to buy 3 more settings without concern. But apart from that, I love it. It's very regal. I feel like I should invite the Queen over for a spot of tea. ---Promotional sample provided for the purpose of candid and objective review."

I received the scale and it came with 2 plastic case type things that was neatly packaged with it. They protect as well as can be used to put on the scale and weight items in them as well. The scale plate is stainless steel. The scale has 4 buttons to operate and a LCD screen display with a blue back light which makes it nice and easy to read your results.  It has many functions.. such as power, tar, mode and pcs. Thankfully I had my son here and he helped go through some of it with me faster. It is pretty easy to use once you begin to use. You can weigh 0.1 gram to 2000 grams.. It has different units depending on different countries :g/oz/ozt/dwt/ct/gn,  you can choose your frequently-used unit. Another great thing is it has a 60 sec Auto Shut off, which is great if you forget to shut it off your not wasting your batteries.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a replacement for my last Cuisinart 12 cup coffee maker (which was probably 6 plus years old); it is almost identical; the only upgrade is this one comes with a little metal coffee filter; you have the option of removing this metal cone and using the paper filters.  From what I have read, I have decided to just use the paper ones as  they remove more sediment and oil.  I like a mild, bitter free coffee (so I use a Chemex whenever I have time--BEST COFFEE MAKER IN THE WORLD IN MY OPINION--but not a good unit when you are going to work or in a hurry--see my review on it).  Anyway, when time is short, this coffee maker is simple to operate, has a small clock (that you can't see very well as it is very small and inconspicuous); the machine is programmable as advertised.  The unit has a small charcoal filter that is easily accessible (it's at the end of the plastic piece that fits in the top left corner of the machine where you put the water in), and it is very easy to change (the plastic double piece just pops open and then you can remove the old filter).  The controls are pretty much the same as my old unit except there is now an off/on switch (my old one you just moved the dial to brew, and  presto it started working).  This unit (like the old one) has a 1 to 4 cup brewing option.  I guess what I am saying is if it isn't broke don't fix  it (or if you have a good product don't make a lot of changes to it--it should last well if you take care of it--like most things in life).  I think it is the best electrical unit on the market for the money."

So if you're out in the woods on a dark night, you have nothing.  Could be scary and even dangerous.  One note that can be either positive or negative is that the beam is pretty focused, more of a spot than a flood, so you can see far in advance.  I like it, so a positive for me.  Living in AK, I never go anywhere in the winter without a headlight.  Most of the time I only use the low beam, which is plenty to find my way around.

I can't think of anything about it that I would change. The base is solid, the whole mechanism snaps together tightly with the metal bar. The separation of juice from the pulp during operation is very effecient. Most of the pulp left over is dry, so you know you're getting your money's worth out of the produce you put into it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Over the last several months, I have received several stainless steel tumblers to test and review.  My husband is the hunting and fishing manager for an international chain sporting goods store, so we also receive a lot of stuff that they sell in the stores, to test at home.  Some of the first tumblers we were sent to try were from Yeti, and so many other brands have followed... Epic, Kodiak, Magnum Steel, Sic-sup, Rtic, and many more more.  This was the most recent cup that we have gotten to try.  We live in Texas, so we like ice cold drinks while we sit in the blazing hot sun.
After hand washing this cup, allowing it to air dry, it was filled with ice, and topped off with water.  Then is was off to the lake for a day in the hot sun! This cup performed very well throughout the day, and was even adopted by my father's girlfriend by the end of our trip.  (I usually give them to family or friends anyways, because we have several still)
The ice that we put in the cup early in the day lasted until we headed back home that night.  We refilled the water a few times, and did top the ice off throughout the day, but it kept the ice and drink just as cold as the other cups like this, that we had taken out there.
Not all of these tumblers perform as well as the top branded ones, but a few of them do stand out as being very good investments.  This cup is one of them! If it had not already been taken home by someone else, we would have been keeping it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"Was hoping to get a decent cup of coffee from this machine but was disappointed. Major problem is that the water is not heated sufficiently when the coffee is brewed to deliver a hot cup of coffee when the brewing process stops. As cold tap water temperatures are somewhat cooler out of the tap in the winter I tried slightly preheating the water before placing it in the coffeemaker...no major improvement. Temperature of coffee in pot immediately after being brewed about 145 degrees.

What's interesting is that the coffee did indeed get hotter after sitting on the heating element than it was after it initially brewed. Unfortunately, we like to drink coffee immediately after it has been brewed not 30 minutes or an hour later. Our old Braun coffee pot delivered much hotter coffee.

A few minor points include the area where you pour water into the coffeemaker being a little smaller than expected,and the need to move the brew water delivery arm back and forth.

This coffee maker was bought as one of a few small things that we put under our Christmas tree to give ourselves so the 30 day return period to Amazon has past otherwise it would go back."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Got the Jebsens LED light in earlier and decided to try it out. I got 4 AA batteries, which install in two compartments in the back, and installed them. I have taken some pictures of the light. One in a pitch black bathroom and the other on our bar with a watch for size comparison. The light has two brackets on the back for hanging it. Screws are included with the light. One thing I really liked about the light is that the lens is frosted. That way, I don't get blinded by the super bright LED's. It puts off tons of light. I was really surprised. There is a three position switch on the side. Off, On, and Auto. When switched in the auto position, it is motion sensitive. I tested this in both low light and no light situations. The light will come on when it detects any motion. I walked in front of the light, then out of it's field of view. The light went off in about 5 seconds. As soon as I walked back to the light, it came on again. It will stay on as long as there is motion in front of it. This will work great in our pantry or under the sink, where there is no lights.  This is a really nice light and is going to make finding that lost can of furniture polish  a lot easier.  I received this product at a discount for my unbiased testing and review.  It is well worth the money. It is the brightest motion sensor light I think I have ever seen. Thanks for a great product."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"There are few flashlights as versital as this. Streamlight makes this device in many vetsions. I prefer the sportsman model as the tactical ones include an infra red led. If you have nvg's you might prefer the tactical versions.

There is one other big difference between the military and sportsman models. The military ones will start at the lowest setting once activated. The sportsman is just the opposite.

The various colored leds serve various rolls. Red keeps up your night vision, great for not disturbing your partner at night when nature cqlls. Green is the color human eyes are mosr sensative to. The blue is a bit of an anigima. Someone with more detailed info should be refrenced here.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"This is a very bright light that is marred by an oversimplified design on the elastic cord that hold the lights in place. But let's start at the beginning. This is a very nice Energizer headset that could have been a lot better except for American corporate insistence on not quite getting things as well as they might have.  They list their light at 150 lumens, which is respectable and serviceable, but certainly not one of the  brightest headsets on the markets. They claim to have made a technological adjustment that makes this four times brighter. But they aren't clear about this. If this is four times brighter, that would mean it is a 600 lumens. If it is 600 lumens, then why not say it? I suspect because it really is just a 150 lumens headset, but they want you to think it is rather more. Regardless, this bright enough for most lighting needs. Where it fails is the headband. I have a couple of other headlamps, and in both instances they constructed the headset with several pieces of elastic. This allows for a couple of things. It provides a more stable perch on the head, which it most certainly provides. It also provides a more comfortable perch for the headlamp. This is simply not a very comfortable headset to wear. The lone band really cuts into your skin when holding it. If you tried to wear this on your head  for any length of time you would begin to experience discomfort and most probably a pressure headache.

This is not a bad headlamp, but there are much better ones available for just about any need. I'm something of an Energizer/Duracel loyalist (I find the two brands to be almost indistinguishable from one another and I will continue to use both this and Duracel products, but this isn't one of Energizer's stronger products."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This chair is comfortable and sturdy when assembled and I am happy with the purchase.  HOWEVER, be advised that assembly was difficult.  I timed it, and it took me 2 hours to put this together and it required two people...the reason for that being that instead of the screws coming loose in a plastic bag like you would expect, this chair has the screws actually screwed in place on the unassembled pieces. I've never seen this before, but it's vexing.  So when putting this chair together, I had to first unscrew the screws that were VERY tightly held in place before I could put the arms on the chair and then rescrew the screws.

The bulk of assembly time was spent on unscrewing the screws -- it felt like an Olympic bodybuilder or a cyborg had tightened these things.  I ended up having to use a flathead screw driver and a wrench to get the screws off (I affixed the wrench to the screwdriver handle to give myself some extra torque and it was the only way I was able to get the screws off).

After that, I required a second person to hold the pieces together as I rescrewed everything together.

You need a lot of patience to be able to take these screws off, folks.  If you are not a patient person, then you should probably look for a chair that has the screws come loose in a plastic bag (the way Ikea does).

I think the price on this chair is great.  The leather is beautiful and so comfortable.  I'm actually sitting in the chair right now and it's giving me great back support.

I would rank this 5 stars if not for the fact it came with all the screws very tightly affixed and all the frustration that caused me.  I bought this chair for $80 but similar ones I saw at Target and other stores were around $125 or so --- so I feel like even with the frustration it was a great value."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Having had an allergy test done, I was found to have pretty strong allergies to Dust Mites. After having my physician suggest getting a bed encasement i chose to go with this offering. One thing i read was that other customers complained of the ""heat"" they experienced. This encasement has 2 sides... one more terrycloth like and one smooth and almost silky. I chose to put the terrycloth side down and have the smoother side near my sheet set. I've not had any issues with heat (matter of fact I was quite cold last night) and my stuffiness in the morning is SIGNIFICANTLY reduced. Due specifically to the improved dust mite situation, i'm sleeping SOOOOOO much better!!!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This little bugger would beat the crap out of some of the lesser quality 18v drills I've used.

I love that it has a 1/2 inch chuck too since I don't own any reduced shank bits.

This drill packs plenty of power and has good runtime.

The handle is thicker than the 18v stuff because the battery slides into it. It doesn't bother me, but it isn't the most comfortable.

The light isn't in the best place either due to the battery design and casts a shadow."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I purchased a different kit than the one listed.  Mine had the Quick-Change adapter with 7 hex shank high-speed drill bits.  The drill bits are of excellent quality as is the click adapter.  All you have to do to insert a bit is push it in.  To remove it simply pull back on the padded collar of the adapter and the bit pops out.  Unlike Sears, Dewalt, Snapy and other quick adapters that I have used you do not have to pull back on the adapter and pull the bit out at the same time. The Bosch just pops it out.  What impressed me the most however was the lack of run out that the Bosh has.  The wobble that is present at the driver bit or drill bit tip that anyone who has ever used any sort of quick change hex shank adapter is much less noticeable with the Bosch than any I have ever used.  I am a solid surface/laminate fabricator and much of my time is spent installing counter tops and kitchen cabinets where a drill is indispensable for drilling as well as driving.  I have 3 of the Bosch Quick-Change adapters one in a Makita, one in a Dewalt, and one in a Metabo cordless drill.  I would not be without one of these Bosch adapters on the work site.  By the way I also use a Dewalt 7.2v screwdriver which is a pleasure to use and comes with a hex shank quick adapter mounted to the drill shaft instead of a chuck and it has more run-out than these Bosch adapters."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Great little juicer!!!  Started using it the night it arrived.  So far I've put apples, carrots, beets, greens, oranges, grapefruit, peaches, plums, onions, garlic, kale, spinach and sweet potatoes through it.  Of all of that, only the beets and sweet potatoes have been an issue.  Their stringy material tends to try and bind the auger but simply turning backwards and loosening it up sends it on through.  The cranking isn't overly difficult or strenuous, although I do wish it would extract a bit more juice, the pulp is still a bit damp when extracted.  Still, all in all for someone that's just starting into juicing, I think it's pretty great.  I should note this was originally bought for wheatgrass juicing and it arrived 5 days faster than I expected so my wheat grass is still growing and not ready to put through it.  Beat tops, carrot tops, kale, and spinach all went through fine, so I'm sure the wheat grass will also."

It is less messy with only one paper towel draped across the top. You can see how the bacon is cooking and either shorten the cooking time or lengthen it to have bacon just the way you like it or need it. Sometimes we need partially cooked bacon to use in recipes where it needs to be flexible for incorporation with other food, and then cooked to completion. This product perfectly satisfies that need. I highly recommend this product for anyone who uses/enjoys perfect bacon."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"This would be great if I wasn't going to be home and wanted lights going on and off at various times during the day and night. But what I want to use it for is to run a water distiller for exactly 5 hrs. The other type of timer was not accurate. This one is, but each time I want to run it, I have to set the time to go on and then off and verify the day and the schedule. The next day always at a different time than the previous day, when I want to run the distiller for five hours, I have to set the timer again as to what time it should go on and then off and also set the day for it to run and whether it should repeat everyday, every other day etc...all settings that are insignificant to me.

I wish I could just set to run for five hours and have it turn off afterwards. It was a lot of money to pay for for what I needed: a simpler setup. I am sure it is great for turning lights on and off randomly, as it says it does.

I have it plugged in an outlet under a wall cabinet which has a light under it but I have to use a flashlight to view the digital screen. It protrudes beyond where the light can shine on it.

When setting the times, if you go past the number you wanted, you cannot reverse it, but have to go all the way around the 12 hrs to get back to the number you wanted. This goes for hours and minutes, days of the week etc, for each of the on and off settings. Kind of a hassle. Anyone know of a simpler timer?"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"These are really handy space-savers for the right situation - I keep them in a spare, ""traveling toolbox"" that I keep in the car.  (I couldn't possibly travel with an entire socket set, so these are great).

Of course, they're useful only for bolts that are within reach, where you have plenty of room to rotate the wrench around the bolt head.

I really like that the tools themselves are very heavy and seem durable, but I'll update my review after I've used them for a while.

As another reviewer mentioned, this set ""...doesn't just replace 8 standard wrench sizes but also covers 6 fastener types, hex, square, 12pt, external torx, partially rounded hex and spline.""  Quite an impressive list.

I gave these tools to my builder to try out, and he loved them!  I had to arm-wrestle him to get them back (just kidding).

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"I really like this vacuum. Charges quickly. One charge does every room of my 1000 sq ft place. I have hardwood floors with a good amount of dog hair and it does a pretty good job with it. Very easy to empty the container. (Which you will need to do after every sweep.) I recommend making sure you clean out the rollers and intake port fairly frequently. It is a compact vacuum and that's what makes it easy and great; but the intake port is pretty small. Just keep it clean an it will work great. It picks up debris well, gets into tight spots and corners, gets fairly low so that you can get a good ways under beds and couches.

EDIT: 6 months later. I still think this is a great vacuum for the price. It will vacuum about 6 rooms (900=1000sq ft) before needing a charge. It picks up most things well. It works well on pet hair and basic dirt. Bigger things take a couple swipes. You should definitely clean out the intake as much as possible because it is small and can get clogged. It doesn't take long to clean it, but it is a little work. Just a screwdriver or wire coat hanger is needed. The battery charges quickly (maybe an hour or two?) and it hasn't seemed to lose any of its total charge in the time I've had it.

Edit: One and a half years later. This vacuum was a good vacuum for the time that I used it. After a year and a half it has now stopped working as well. Very little suction power. Doesn't pick up dirt like it should. I need a new vacuum now."

Everything about this is rocking. Quality, ease of installation, operational modes and even the look and feel. I am with an electrical engineering background so that may not be fair to say ""ease"" of installation but I did think it to be quite easy.

Love the stepping mode for the lights. I used 4 new LED in the light part of the ceiling fan and if you want to dim a bit, you have plenty of levels. It also saves the point you want for a quick change to the level you find to be good for you. Same with the fan for everything described; stepping, favorite spot, off/on etc.

Only one minor gripe is that the remote must be pointed at the switch unit as this is where it picks it ip. IR, not RF. This is not a major deal at all unless you have something sitting right in front of it."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,Have had this drill for about 4 years.  Carried in my pickup for quick repairs on family jobs.  Have now gone through 4 sets of batteries (8).  Batteries last only a few months and then show to be defective.  I expected more from Ridgid.  I finally chunked the two drills and  changed to a Dewalt 18V.  Single unit with 2 batteries.  A bit larger but so much more power and after 6 months the Dewalt Batteries still going good.  Would recommend something besides a Ridgid if even knowing the problem with its batteries Ridgid continues to put their name on these CRAP Batteries.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I actually bought this to use with small jar candles rather than tarts. It works perfectly for me and I love the pretty green color. I cannot have an open flame in my office, so this is an excellent substitute. It heats the small candle thoroughly, does not take up lot of room, and is easy to use. The cord could be longer, but this is not a deal breaker. I love the product itself and am very happy I decided to get it. My office smells wonderful all the time now!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Had two issues on install (a Master Electrician was on the job and I am a professional engineer):
1.  The item cannot be installed through the recommended hole size no matter how you turn it -- the hole needs to be about 5/8"" longer.  This in turn cannot be fully hidden by the cover plate- about 1/4"" shows.  This has to be covered after install.  Easy to do but disappointing.
2.  The unit would not work properly upon first install.  We found that there were some internal connectors hidden inside an internal box that had not been put together completely.  snapped those together. put the box cover back on, rechecked and it has worked perfectly ever since.  Again, easy to fix (but hard to find the issue) and disappointing.
Once working the unit is a dream -- very, very quiet operation, good volume on the exhaust and quick warm-up using the heater.  Nite light is just right.  I would recommend this unit, but caution folks about the two items above for the install."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"Okay, initially sent in a five-star rating, but this is why I hate to commit to a review early on; I've had this light installed for just a few months and it has failed.  Constant on/off of the light once is gets to dusk; had to shut it off altogether.  I wish I had looked at the negative reviews first because I wouldn't have bought this.  I'm not planning on getting any satisfaction from the company because apparently, they don't honor warranties, but I will try.  It's too bad; it seemed to be just what I wanted."

I've only had these for one day, but so far, I think they're great."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,I bought 6 of these. They are the best. The first one I got was just a little too small. I am using it for the first time in a very large deck. I have been using it for a while and it is very useful. The other one I bought is just a bit smaller and I can't use it on the first day of the week because I have had to use it for a few days. I will buy another one for the weekend. The other one I have used for the first time is a bit smaller.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I'm very pleased with the quality and look of this set and the excellent service!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Pros:
Casters can be removed and stored within the bottom of the unit, securely for storage.
Cord has storage compartment with a closing door, which latches securely.
Four Heat settings.
Silent.
Highly Effective.

Cons:
Documentation is a little dated, refers to the switches on the unit being a rotary type dial control.

While the product description does mention a circulation fan, I don't see one - and frankly I'm glad it doesn't seem to have one.  It's silent, totally silent.  Setting switch 3 (Bottom Element) to ON (375 Watts), more than ample to heat my entire upstairs.  A pleasant slow event heat.

The product isn't UL listed, but it is ETL listed.  There is an overheat circuit interrupt with a button on the back of the unit, and sensitive tip over cut-off switch.  Very pleased with the safety of the unit overall.

The unit functions in two ways, first is the reflective heat you can see and feel when the unit is ON; it feels like warm sunshine.  Second, it functions as a convection heater; air passes through from the cold floor up through the unit and is released via a grill on the top of the unit.

Switch Layout:
Switch 3 - Bottom Element
Switch 2 - Top Two Elements
Switch 1 - Second From Bottom Element

Dial:
No temperature markings, does have a very wide travel path; so accurate temperature control is very easy.

Most heaters of this type are two settings only, ~1000 Watt, and ~1500 Watt.  This results in good warmth, but results in the area in front of the unit being warmer than the rest of the room.

When I purchased, there were only two reviews on this unit.  One review was particularly harsh and gave a One-Star due to the misprint about the fan. I decided to take the plunge and buy the heater anyway; very glad for my decision to buy."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I bought this (not on Amazon) to replace a Cuisinart CPT-180 which I moved to my 2nd home in FL, and still works well. I too bought it for the retro look (as I did the Cuisinart) but looks aren't everything. It toasts much slower than its predecessor. If I read an expert review right, the light/dark knob controls a timer rather than a toast sensor, which means no consistency between say white or wheat bread, etc.

On the plus side, I have used it for 18 months with no problems other than the slow toasting. And the slots will take large bagel halves. But I'm done with it. Ordering the Cuisinart CPT-180 today."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Great holder,  only issue is it doesn't stay in place after a few uses. If you have two hands, it's a bit difficult to hold the lid on it. The only thing I wish it were a little more compact is the size. I would have preferred the rubber seal to the lid, but it's not the problem. I think the design is perfect for my purposes. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs one. This is a great product for the price."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"These are terrible for scooping icecream. I think its because the slider piece is not close enough to the scoop... the icecream gets stuck & the scoop gets stuck out, so you must have super human strength to squeeze open or close  the handle & even then, the icecream doesn't come out.  I have tried soaking in hot water & it just makes a mess of melted icecream. These Look like the real thing (there are some that look like these that are much better quality!)  I used the smaller one for cookie dough & that one actually works quite well. Maybe I got a dud on the big one."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,This one came to me broken!! The handle was a broken piece!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,I just opened this item and it was the best. I will keep my review for a couple months. If you want to get a solid product then the Treme Tops should work for you. I have been using this in my bed for about a week now and it has not moved. I put it on the bed and it is very comfortable and it is a great quality. I love the fact that it has a nice depth to it and it is a good size for my queen size bed. I am hoping that it will last for years to come. I will definitely be ordering another one. I am happy with this

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"When a sump pump goes bellyup it usually happens when you need it most. Which means you can't wait for shipping or shop price, you head to the hardware store and pay top buck. After numerous Wayne pump float switches died (usually just after the warranty expires)I saw this one with the Switch Genius technology. At 3/4 HP it was more pump than I needed and it was the most expensive sump pump I ever bought. But I figured if the switch was more reliable than float switches the piece of mind would be worth the money.

I noticed the switch cycles the pump on early and shuts off only after sucking air for 10 - 15 seconds. After some severe storms a few weeks later I came home from work and could smell something hot. The pump wasn't turning off and was hotter than blazes! After following the manual and cleaning off the sensor it still wouldn't shut off. After unplugging the pump for half an hour or so it appeared to work normally again. Every time there's a storm I have trouble with the water sensor not shutting off the pump. Wayne says to send it back for a replacement on my dime. It weighs a ton and is going to be expensive to ship. Plus, what do I do for a pump while there's two in transit?

I had a Zoeller pump for over ten years with no problems until the switch died. I had to go with Waynes because that's what the hardware store carried and like I said, when you need a replacement you usually need it in a hurry. I've gone through 5 Wayne pumps in 6 years, this will be the last."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"The product worked quite well. It did what it was designed to do.

I wish it had come with some instructions though. When inserting the LED strip, peel the paper off the end you're inserting; look closely, there is a little slot the LED needs to go into, then it needs to slide under the two tabs just a bit. If you don't get it in just right, the connection will not always work. If you take care while doing this, you should have no problems."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,These are exactly as pictured and look great. They look great in our log home with our burlap curtains.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I've been in the market for a nice tumbler for awhile, I've tried a few others...but I've had my issues with them. Namely, they sweat when you put ice in them, or the bottom of cup is way too narrow to stick my hand in and clean the thing, or the plastic straw wears out or develops a curve over time....However, the Chillz Stainless Steel Tumbler has been great. It doesn't sweat, I love the size, 30 oz lets me put in enough ice and still have enough room for water so I don't have to keep filling the thing back up, the larger base also allows me to clean it with relative ease, what I really like about it is the stainless steel straw, I've never had one before and it's been a game changer in my opinion.  For me it seems it makes the drink feel colder when you have a lot of ice in it, not to mention is also doesn't bend over time.  There are a few drawbacks though...Namely the lid isn't exactly spill proof, there's an opening at the top for the straw, but it's a big opening so the star can move around and if you knock it over (which I have) you'll get a decent sized mess to clean up, the other thing is that it's not dishwasher safe, which is no big deal because like I said, it's easy to clean, but if your big on not doing dishes then this may not be for you. Overall, a great buy at a great value."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,Cheap parts - the screw broke when I was screwing into the stud in the wall. Overall it functions correctly but was surprised by the broken screw...
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I LOVE these. The only reason it isn't five stars is because it is a little smaller than I anticipated.

Unlike some other reusable bags I have, you don't have to fold this a certain way to get it back together. You just wad it up to stuff it back into the flower pocket and pull it tight and it looks as good as when it arrived!

It comes with a small clip if you want to clip it to a backpack, purse, or you can just put them all on one hood by their string to keep them all together when not in use.

They are small and don't take up a lot of room. I always have one in my purse when I go to a festival just in case I decide to make some purchases. I like the different colors, and when you open it, it's just that plain color, but has one stem on it, keeping the rose theme.

It's a great price, so I love throwing one in with a gift etc. Everyone really seems to like them and think they are clever and useful.

As for size, like I said it is much smaller than anticipated. This is definitely not a good bag to take grocery shopping when you plan on trying to stuff as many things as possible into the bag. When I gave one to a friend, she said it was the perfect size for milk. I think getting a whole gallon in here might not be optimal, but it can definitely carry a half gallon easily... It does feel strong, so you can fit small heavier things in here, it just isn't a LARGE bag."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,Nice and heavy like I expected. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver.

This coffee maker is a great value. I have a Norpro coffee maker that uses a larger size coffee maker, so I would highly recommend this one.

It works great, and the size is perfect.  I used it for the kitchen and it works great.  I also have the old Schlage bulb that was replaced with this one.  This one has a nice white light.  I like that the bulb is longer than the old bulbs, which is nice.  I use this with my Dewalt lamp, which has a longer bulb and a smaller one.  The lamp has a nice white light, and the lamp is warm white.  I have to say it works great for the kitchen.  I had a few issues with it, but the only one I have was that I had to turn it off and on, which is a little weird because I didn't want to go to bed at night.  This light is brighter than the old bulb, but it is still pretty bright.  I would recommend this light to anyone who needs a more bright light.I was very impressed with this light.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,CG,"These work fine in my kitchen. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver.

I had to replace the driver with a different one, so it is not a big deal.

The light is a bit large for my tastes, but it is not going to get in the way of the sink.

I have not used the CFL light yet, but I will probably order another one as it is cheaper and more convenient.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,This planer has added a whole new dimension to my small musical instrument building shop.  I can now cut up my own wood and plane it to whatever thickness I desire and the surfaces come out as smooth and level as a sheet of glass.  Good quality and the blades seem to be holding their edge quite well.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"The first set of torches I received were not working.  I had to contact amazon customer service and they were excellent in guiding me on how to return it.  I received a set of new torches shortly and only two worked after a few months.  I thought maybe I needed new rechargeable batteries for the two that didn't work so I took the batteries out of the good ones and put them in the ones that didn't work-it still didn't work.

The reason I bought these tiki lights were because they looked really nice but my purchase experience was not too pleasant.  When the lights failed shortly after my purchase I thought that was that and therefore the one star review, however, the seller reached out to me to replace them.  I was very pleasantly surprised that this company stood behind their product.  I just received a new set today that they sent me just in time to enjoy the ambience in my backyard for the Fourth of July.  Although I gave the product a one star rating I give this company a 5 star rating for their excellent customer service."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Interesting concept, so I bought them.  Frankly, I find I don't eat anything that requires them:  I eat sushi with chopsticks, and never items that are small or medium nuggets served very hot - hot wings or fried fish straight from the pan, for example.  They're not hard to manipulate, but I don't think I'd reorder or offer for guests to use."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This DeWalt planer stand is well made and sturdy.  The DeWalt 735x, this stand, and customer support from DeWalt's Ed Ryan, has made me a fan of DeWalt.  For me, this stand would be even better if it had two tool drawers underneath.
  Okay, I just put together my second of these stands for a new drill press.  The fit and finish was consistent with the fine quality of the first one.  Be sure to not fully tighten the top-side supports before putting on the top, or you will have to go back and loosen them all in order to align the top holes with the bolts. This time, I used my Hilti impact driver on setting 1 which made putting this stand together take only 25 minutes."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"April 2012 - great product, looks great, and the instructions are very easy to follow.Very nice.I bought this to replace the Schlage 32-60-8 bulb that I replaced with this one.  It works great, and the size is perfect.  I used it for the kitchen and kitchen tables.  I did have to replace the bulb on the kitchen countertop.  I just installed it with the original LED bulbs and it works great!  I would recommend this product for any kitchen or dining room fixture.I bought these to replace my old version of the LED bulbs that were always on.  These are very bright, and the included charger is very handy.  I use them on my new 5 watt fluorescent lamp, and they work well.  I had a few issues with the light, but it was not the issue I was expecting.  I just installed the new bulbs and the light was great.  I would recommend these to anyone.Great buy.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Interesting design and I like the metal cabinet. The heater is nice for heating a select area as the warmth is directed towards the area it is directed at by the reflector surface behind the tubes while a lot of the heat comes out the top vents from the natural air flow. The wheels make it very easy to move to a different location. It did have a smell for the first fifteen minutes of operation but that was only the first time it was used. I don't hear any sound from it at all and the glow from the tubes has the brightness of a nightlight. Best feature I like is the four heat settings, each one turns on an additional tube for added warmth and allows me to set it for just the heat needed. The back and sides stay cool as the heat is directed out the front and the vented top. Only reason I didn't give it five stars was there was no color choice and I wish it had been cheaper to buy, but with the metal cabinet I guess the price is to be expected."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,Water stained and hard to keep clean.  Need to wipe after each use. I would return it if I could.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,Nice product.  I got this to replace an old bulb that was dead for a couple of years.  The bulb had a plastic plastic case that was the same size as the bulbs and was just as bright as the old bulb.  The new bulb is very bright and gives off a warm light.  I have a dimmer switch on the old bulb and it is so bright that I can't see the lights in the dimmer switch.  I have a pair of new bulbs that are close to the same size and they are brighter.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"How many times do you find yourself in the kitchen with a sharp knife and an unprotected hand?  I can tell you I've got lovely scars from the times I've cut myself slicing a bagel or some other awkward item.  I no longer have a problem with cutting myself now that I have a pair of NoCry Cut Resistant Gloves.

The first thing that I did when I put my cut resistant gloves on was to run a knife across my hand.  I used a very sharp Chefcoo knife and it didn't pop even one thread.

I received a pair of large NoCry gloves, because I have large hands.  I found that they fit my hands perfectly without added gaps or sag.  My 21 year old son, who happens to be 6'5"", was not able to get his hand into a glove because his hand was so large.

The NoCry cut resistant gloves are made from a food grade, non-toxic material and with cutting-edge silica-based fibers and are completely machine washable.  I found that I still had full use of my hands and I didn't lose any sensitivity in my grip or handling.

I already appreciate having my pair of NoCry cut resistant gloves in my kitchen to protect my hands and the hands of my loved ones.  You'll love having a pair in your kitchen too.

I'm a product review blogger and I received this product in exchange for an honest review."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Fantastic tumbler.  I have used Yeti products and love them.  But love the RTIC products more...same performance at half the cost (or less).  Filled this tumbler about 2/3 of the way with ice cubes and then filled with water yesterday at 1pm.  As of 12:15 this afternoon there was still a good chunk of ice left in the tumbler.  Have not yet tried it for hot liquids, but the cold performance is outstanding."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"After searching many websites for vacuums I was more than confused.  Attempting to get reviews that I felt comfortable with led me to Amazon.  All I can say is that every positive review on here was correct.  This Dirt Devil packs a great punch for the money.  It is extremely light weight and versatile, the carrying strap makes it even more so.  It fits under furniture that my canister does not.  It is great for autos, steps, and bare floors, which is what i wanted; I use my canister for the wall to wall.  It is easy to empty the dirt container and because it is clear, it is easy to see when it is full. The cord is also long enough for me to do an entire room and with the strap attached, I just walk and vac.  My cleaning time has been cut in half with this unit and I highly recommend it to everyone."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,This was purchased for use in a small space and it is a nice piece of furniture. It is so small that it is not worth the extra money. It is very large so it is a little difficult to put together.

He is so enchanted with the machine and so proud of himself for buying it, that he put the machine in the center of his Etruscan marble-top kitchen table.  He and I start each business day in his kitchen having a cup of coffee.  Maybe my taste palette is dead from years of Mr. C. coffee, but coffee from this new machine tastes EXACTLY like the old stuff."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This mattress protector is great to protect my sons mattress from potential accidents. It doesn't add any more comfort to the mattress, but it certainly isn't uncomfortable. It fits his mattress nicely and doesn't budge during the night.

The stitching is nice and it is made well. I've washed it a few times, and it didn't fray or shrink in the wash.

It does what it is suppose to do and what I expected from it.

I did receive this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, but all opinions are 100% my own. I did not receive compensation or payment in any way."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I was hesitant to buy these based on some of the reviews. I can say after using them numerous times I love them. I use a large covered frying pan and this allows me plenty of room to poach 4 eggs at one time. I keep the water level low enough that none gets inside the cups. The cups are super simple to use and the eggs come out perfect every single time. Clean up is a snap. I highly recommend this product.

I used mounting tape to attach to the wall since I want minimal damage. The panels are light so maneuvering them was not an issue. Theyd break under extreme force so don't be reckless.

I also used a panel to frame my makeshift mirror for my vanity corner. Theyre very handy."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"The design of this faucet is Transitional bordering on Contemporary. The Stainless Steel matches my Decor Range, Kenmore Refrigerator and GE microwave, which is hard to match all of these appliances since every manufacture is a little different.  The pull down is very easy to use and works better than having a separate sprayer.  The faucet is easy to clean and keep cleaned as well.  The installation was very easy and the instructions were good but not great.  I have installed a few faucets so I had a working understanding of what I was doing.  Not sure when manufactures stopped using words to describe how to put things together or install but the pictures didn't make the installation any easier.  The hardest part of installing the faucet was removing the old one but once I removed the garbage disposal and made room to get behind the sink the installation went very smoothly.  Once the old faucet was removed the total installation time was less than a 1/2 hour.  The handle can be installed to the left or the right based on your desire.  We installed on the left and used the old sprayer spot for a soap dispenser."

It is awful having to clean or adjust your eyewear when there's a ton of dust or particles flying through the air.  Earlier this year, I scratched my cornea because I wanted to complete a project but grew tired of cleaning my goggles every so often.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"Functions reasonably well and so far accurate at temperature readings with ~3 months of weekly use.  The low rating is for the ridiculously complex and counter-intuitive programing which renders it essentially useless beyond the basic function of telling the temperature remotely. I just built a pc and found it easier than trying to operate this unit.  In addition, it's very difficult to read the numbers on the face unless you pick up the unit and press the light button.  This is about the 4th different remote thermometer that I have tried and all have problems, not sure where to find one with the combination or reliability, intuitive programming, easy to read data."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"When I set out to buy a slow cooker for my mom, I was looking at higher models with all the bells and whistles and the convertible ones that are like 7 different kind of pots in one.  All digital, high-tech, everything mom did NOT want, lol.  I then reluctantly refocused and set out to find just a slow cooker that was roomy, easy to clean, had manual controls and no extra ""features"" that break down and people seldom use.  After viewing just about every offering on Amazon, I settled on this one because I liked the locking mechanism in case mom ever wanted to take her culinary delights on the road.  Knowing how picky mom is and how unhappy she would be if she didn't like it, I held my breath, hit buy and continued to hold my breath until it was delivered and the final verdict came in ... Then one day I got an excited call from a very happy, gourmet-chef mom who loved this slow cooker!  She uses it at least 3x/ wk and I get to hear about all the amazing things she's been cooking in this baby :)).  Mom especially likes the locking mechanism and how it easy it is to clean.  The cooker heats up quickly, cooks evenly and definitely does not spill when taken for a ride. Then she mentioned how relieved she was that I didn't send her one of those ""other"" ones ... Lol."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Awww I love these! I eat a lot of soup, and hate when my spoon falls into it. :) They work great for cereal too.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"I purchased this nailer after my Dewalt 18v finish nailer decided to take a vacation. I install doors for a living, and needed a nailer with enough stank behind it to countersink nails through 5/4 material. I almost purchased a new Dewalt but this Ryobi had decent reviews, a comparable warranty, but a much better price point. All of my hand tools are Ryobi so I had more than enough batteries/chargers on hand. My experience with Ryobi tools has been a positive one. I'm extremely rough on my equipment, and they have all held up to the beating. Anyway, this nailer is OK. If you're using it for the occasional project, and don't mind having a few floating nails, it'll do just fine. This nailer however, did not meet my expectations. Didn't matter if I was using 2 inch nails or 2 1/2....didn't matter if I was nailing into a low profile interior trim, or thicker 5/4 material...didn't matter if I had the depth as deep as it would go and the compression gauge all the way to max...didn't matter how I held the gun against the material...it just wouldn't countersink the nails consistently. Maybe 6/10 successful countersinking. That meant more time manually punching nails and filling holes. Another issue I was having was the constant ""skipping"" off the nail head causing basically 2 holes to puddy AND the nail head was not countersunk. That didn't happen too often, but it was enough to make me say aloud, ""what the???"" The price listed above is insane- I picked up mine at the Home Depot for $200. It's possible I just had a defective product, because all the other reviews I've read were glowing for this exact same product. It's possible it was defective, but it's possible the next one will be too- so I'm going to purchase the newer Senco F16. Same conveniences, still less than Dewalt, and looks like a space-gun.
I gave it 2 stars because I still love Ryobi, and other than this experience- their other tools have stood up to my wrath."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Our house has one of these in the kitchen, the builder's electrical contractor dissuaded us from putting more in as ""they are easy to install and cost a fraction of what we charge you""  Well the first part is true, they are easy to install.  The second part is patently false as it cost $16 each for each installed unit in our house and as one can clearly see here they cost more!  However, when you are in the mess of building a house, little things like research can get swept under the rug with work and the myriad decisions one has to make in a hurry.

Like most homes today, ours is littered with device charges of different types, their power blocks and cables all over the place. Family and guests  are constantly vying for the coveted outlets that are high enough the dog can't get at the cords or devices when your back is turned!  This little gem, like the other in our kitchen allows 3 devices to charge at once if needed.  And keeps the wife's recipe book, I mean iPad, ever charged while she is cooking and looking along with her phone...and gives her an outlet for an appliance!

This receptacle is quick and easy to install, just make sure you turn the breaker off, so as not to end up in the ER or worse!  The instructions are spot on.

The USB port is 2.1 amp, so it charges fast.  Harder on the battery, yes, but fast.  iPhone 6+ went from zero to full in about 20 min, that is an estimate as I wasn't timing precisely.

I highly recommend this unit to anyone."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"This review could get better, but I thought it would be better to make a small review about the other two.  The first one is that the ring is not sturdy, and it's not as well made as the other one.  The other is that the two pieces are not the same height.  They are the same height, but the ring on the other one is more of a height mismatch.  I'm guessing it is because the ring is a little shorter than the other one.  I don't know why.  I'm guessing it is because the ring is a little longer than the other one, because the ring is not thicker.  The ring is not made of much material, and the ring does not have a ""ring"" on it.

I got them, mounted them up in the shop and flipped the switch. The one came on, the other I needed to use the pull chain for, however that's when I discovered their lack of quality. With the slightest pull on the pull chain the whole switch and bottom plate came off. In looking at where the screws go in, everyone of them was split. I took the other one down and examined it and it was in the same shape. I don't have time to mess with returning them and having a dark shop for a week or more while the replacements show up so I just drilled out where the screws go through and used small bolts, nuts and washers to mount the switch plate back on both of them. It won't come apart now, but I have doubts that these will even be functional in a years time with as cheap as they're made."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Worked great.  Replaced one that was stiff and had to be fought when showering.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I bought these curtains because my husband works nights and he wanted the room to be nice and dark so he could sleep peacefully during the day. These curtains work beautifully!

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This is a great product that provides precision drilling for a good price. The vise (Proxxon 28132) is a must. The unit is compact. Even after reading other reviews about the size, when the box arrived it was smaller than anticipated. That said, it has more than exceeded expectations."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I wanted a silverware tray that was cheap in price, but good in quality.

I put this in my kitchen drawer backward, so the junk compartment is to the front, but the spoons, etc., are still in easy reach.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,Great for weighing in lbs and oz not grams. Fast shipping.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Fantastic - Love the tubes and the suction cups. I also love that the dimensions are just the right
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"Like most folks, I'd like to spend as little money as possible to complete my projects. Skimping here was not a great idea, however. If you're not aware of what a proper connector should look like, or if durability is not a concern, then this certainly looks like a great deal. It's half the price of a quality part. And I've returned mine, because I'm not willing to save money at the expense of significant quality reduction. Yes these look like the connector you want. But don't be fooled. They're the Playskool version of the real thing. Great for display or demonstrations, but I won't use them to pass 30A of 230V.

I never thought I'd become a ""connector snob"" but here I am. The high quality Leviton units are well worth the extra money, because their quality IS that much better."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"works great & great build quality.  However, I would not recommend to use with an electric snow blower.  The cable is just to thick to use in cold weather.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,CG,"At first, this was a little bulky, but once you get it on, it's a pretty good size. I had to replace a couple of the plastic plastic switches in the case, but it's a little smaller than the size of the previous one. This is still a good size, and a bit smaller than the one I had in the old one. I think the new one will be just fine, but I'm not sure if it will be able to hold up to the heat of the old one.

They operate on either one AA cell battery, OR one 14500 3.6v rechargeable battery. They are considerably brighter with the 14500 battery but work quite well with a regular old AA battery.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"We love our instant pot! Makes amazing rice!
Great pressure cooker without the stress of watching it!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,This was adorable and not very hard to apply.  I can't give it five stars because I've bought other wall decals where the application and removal was super easy.  This was a little more difficult because you have to pull off one layer and stick it on the wall in the perfect location the first time or else you're in trouble.  Because this is a small wall decal it was pretty easy.  I recommend this for anyone with a weirdly placed bathroom that people often mistake for a closet =)
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Nice set of bulbs, they aren't too bright but bring a nice ambient light. They are very attractive, interesting. People always ask about them. I have them throughout my kitchen, again if you haven't purchased these before they are dim."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Ever bought lettuce or spinach and, after 3 days in the fridge, find that it's turning to a slimy mess?  Got concerns about E. coli and other bacteria on your leafy greens?

If you eat salads, you NEED a salad spinner. And after trying several, I'm here to tell you this is the one you want. 1)  Put your veggies in the bowl. Pour a cup of white vinegar over it, and fill with cold water. Agitate it with your (clean, recently washed) hands and let it sit for a few minutes. 2)  Lift the basket out and pour out the vinegar / water. Fill again with cold water and agitate by hand. 3)  Lift the basket and pour out the water, then spin, spin spin. 4)  Pour out the water and wipe the remaining droplets with a paper towel. 5)  Put the basket back in, lock the spinner down, and store in the fridge. Lettuce and spinach lasts twice as long using this method than just storing in the fridge."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This thing is the bomb!! Easy to use (with two people), and does the trick thoroughly. My vent was super clogged (and I knew that going in to the cleaning process). We proceeded slowly, doing only the top ten feet first, then proceeding down to the next sections. So, we probably lowered it down a total of 5 times. We used cell phones to communicate with each other. The person on the roof lowers the hose down (with the air flow off), then turns on the air flow and slowly pulls the hose up. Pounds of lint came out with each pass. It helps to loosely cover the lower vent opening with a bag (or pillowcase) when the air is switched on, to save from a big mess inside the laundry room. When the hose finally makes it down to the lower opening, and the air is turned on, a nasty blast of lint will come out of the end (as it should), but nothing like what comes out of the top of the vent. The direction of the blast coming out of the ball on the end of the hose systematically keeps the lint rolling upward and outward. There was nothing left in my dryer vent after the last pass. My clothes dry TWICE as fast as they used to."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Love it. I think I will buy more.Very nice set of knives!  I have one
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Very comfortable to durable mattress.  The only problem is that it's not really comfortable to sleep on.  I had to get a pillow cover out of the box

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Before you purchase & then leave a bad review  always read the product description. As stated this is a 10 hour charger that does not include a charging cord. This charger works great with my lithium & standard Stinger batteries. Unlike standard batteries lithium batteries will blink when fully recharged when using this device.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Got this for winter home to control thermostat from 1800 miles away. It works perfectly! Easy to install and setup.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I love these.  Definitely a great purchase.  I keep parrots in my home and burning candles are often toxic to the birds.  I saw candles like these on a recent trip to Costa Rica and was really glad to find them here on Amazon.  They truly look like real burning wax candles.  The added bonus is the timer that turns them on for several hours, and then off again.  I highly recommend these."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"These are just as described. They are lightweight and comfortable. I also like the fact that they do not have the dishwasher, which is nice, but not a big deal."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,CG,"It's a well thought out solution. The only problem is that it's not really a replacement for the other two. The plastic parts are also not as good as the original. The only thing I can say is that I would prefer it to be made of some sort of plastic. I'm not a fan of the plastic parts, but the one I received was fine. I just wish it came with a different plastic part."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,One of my best purchases!  I love the look and feel of this lamp.  It has a nice touch of the dimmable design.  The light output is nice and strong.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I adore this product!  I appreciate when it's evident that designers gave thought to things like how to make a product take up less space when stored and how to maximize convenience when used.  The color is great and the silicon has a nice feel that provides a good grip.  When collapsed, this lunch box is very compact, making it easy to store.  Also love that it's dishwasher safe.  The best part though is just its overall functionality.  I love the addition of the fork/spoon utensil and that it clips down securely into the top.  The compartments are generously sized.  The top has latches on all four sides, ensuring there won't be any leaks.  (Keep in mind that there isn't a complete barrier between the compartments internally though, so it is possible for the compartments to leak a bit into each other, depending on the contents and the direction the lunch box is carried in.)

My son is involved in a great many events each summer through our local parks & recs program and often needs to bring a lunch along.  The portability of this versatile product will serve us well in this regard!  Even if he flips his canoe, his lunch should stay dry and tasty!

Like you, I rely on reviews when selecting products to purchase. As a product tester, I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for providing an honest review, but this review is based solely on the merits of this product itself; any discount I may have received has no bearing on my assessment and evaluation of it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This thing is quality. The weight is perfect, just heavy enough to prove its granite, but not too heavy. It grinds things to a pulp! There is some dust when you first use it, but just grind itself under water for a little while, let it dry out, and you are good to go."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Excellent quality product. Perfect for my ccozinha.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Haven't used these light bulbs yet but I'm sure they will do the
job when I need them.  Arrived promptly and in good condition."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"I know about flashlights.  Nothing in this review will be an exaggeration, honestly.  This light is not usable in any sense.  The output can only be described as dim.  Thats not a comparative statement.  The ""beam"" is orange and barely visible.  If you're looking at something small within 2ft of your face,  you can see it if you strain your eyes.  Negotiating the dark is impossible.  Ive honestly never seen a dimmer light in any size, and this one is alot larger
than most keychain lights."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I have to dress the blade (with aluminum oxide dressing stick) after every few dozen cuts to maintain a minimum amount of blowout in the back of the translucent glass tiles But I think that is pretty standard. Using this in conjunction with a Dewalt wet saw has consistently produced very smooth and accurate cuts. Most cuts are so smooth I do not need to use a sanding stone to smooth the edges of the tiles. Additionally, the blade has allowed me to accurately make U-shaped cut-outs for electrical boxes and NOT have to use tile nippers. The side of the blade is good for grinding sideways along a line so the cut-outs are smooth."

The sensor is very good at sensing ambient light during the day and switching off. In darker corners, however, if the daylight is insufficient to trigger the sensor the light will stay on. In our case this is welcomed as we have a darker stairwell and the LED light provides enough light both night and day. Recommended and a good value for the price."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Bought as gift for bear loving person. big hit. great quality and lots of details in the figurine. have bought several products from this mfg.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"First I'll talk about the set-up process. Mercy, it was a pain! Once I got over the overwhelming amount of pieces and hardware, the set-up started off easily enough. I was fooled into thinking things would go smoothly. That changed quickly. I had a hard time getting many of the little hardware pieces to fit where they were supposed to. It was very frustrating. The worst part, I think, was the sticky paper that was attached to the glass-like plastic shelves. It did not come off easily! I ended up having to buy a bottle of ""goo gone"" to help get it off, because it looked so horrible.

Now to the looks of the final product. I don't really have any complaints. It not overly my style, so it's ended up as a storage shelf in my boys' closet. It's hard black plastic and thick white paper for the most part. It looks like something you'd see in a garage or maybe a dorm room or classroom setting. I think more than anything, it will depend on a person's individual style.

Overall, is this something I would recommend to my family and friends? No, unfortunately not. I think there are easier and less expensive options for what it is. Other than the set-up process, though, I don't have any complaints at this point, so I also wouldn't overly NOT recommend it, either."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,"iv seen these for as little as 3 cents a bulb.

The only reason I ordered this is because I had a similar model at Home Depot that was advertised to be 4.5"" and had no sockets in it.  The one I got was 4.5"" and the one I received was just a bit smaller.  I'll try to figure out how to replace it for my kid.  I'm sure it won't work.

This bulb is very bright and very easy to install.  The included instructions were fairly easy to understand, but I didn't get the wiring instructions from Home Depot.  The instructions are also not as clear as I had hoped.

I'm sure I'll get another one for my family.  I've had no problems with this bulb.  It's very bright and I'm happy with the results.Works great on my Milwaukee automatic tool.  Easy to use and a great price.These are really nice.  They are made of good quality, but not very soft.  I used them to make a very strong wooden edge for a very strong wooden fence.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Awesome quality very strong and you can stand on this skylight covers as shown on some prodcut pictures. I'm stciking with Icon products for any of my rv roof cover needs
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I purchased this after a friend recommended it to me.  I am not a power baker.  I merely make the usual things for my family and the occasional specialty items.  I find it mixes faster than my old stand mixer, and it takes less space on my counter.  Contrary to other reviewers, I find it does cream sugar and butter well, BUT I have to use a rubber spatula to push it off the center post.  MY machine came with instructions to NOT use the center addition for the smaller jobs like this since it produces better results, so that is how I have done it.

In addition, I noticed straightaway that the directions stated to ensure you run the machine at least 5 minutes before you do ANYTHING in it to make sure the lubricants do their job BEFORE you use it for mixing. I did that, and I've heard no odd noises coming from my machine.

It IS loud.....much louder than my stand mixer, but I wasn't going for a silent machine.  Frankly, I have dexterity issues, and I wanted one that wasn't overly heavy, with a bowl that wasn't overly heavy, and that was easy to clean without having to wrestle it all over the kitchen (with my issues, that's common).  My friend suggested that this would probably tick off all those checkboxes, and she was right.

For what I use it for, I LOVE it.  It is also easy to clean, the parts store in the top, and it does what I ask it to.  I also got the blender attachment with mine, and it blends stuff that my bullet cannot.  I don't use it OVERLY often, but when I need a blender, it's a champ.  The only thing I don't like about the blender is that you cannot remove the bottom and blades to clean it.  If I used it daily or for anything very sticky, that would bother me, but I'm just a batter making, smoothie making gal, and it's great for that."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This is the second quart I've ordered.  I'd  faux-painted my cabinet tops to look like marbel ( people can't tell the difference...I'm an artist), but after some months the thin coating I'd put on top of the water-based layers of paint  to water-proof it was failing.  I'd tried several different products, but they just didn't last (with  the dishes/pots/pans I put on the counter top).  This product has lasted and has given a great shine.  It's tough!  After a year, there is some wear on the side of the sink where I put most of my dishes/pot/pans....... but I can just put on a few more brush strokes of this stuff and it blends perfectly.  In fact, I've corrected some of errors in the past of poor brush strokes........with a few strokes (top to bottom of the counter of course to create a complete brush stroke).  Blends right in."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,CG,"If you ever think about using an electric drill, you know it's important to know what you're talking about.  The drill itself is very powerful, and the cover is very sturdy.  The blades are very sharp, and the motor is very quiet.  The drill also comes with a small 2-volt battery, and it's very easy to set up.  I also like the fact that the drill has a nice rubber grip on the motor, and that it has a convenient grip on the motor when you're pulling it around.  This is a nice feature, and a great addition to any drill.  The drill is a good drill, and one that I use often.

The drill is a bit small, but not too big.  I've had it for a while now, and the size of the drill is good enough to hold in my hand.  I prefer that the drill is smaller than my older drill, but that's not really a big deal.

The motor is very quiet, and the motor is very quiet.  The motor does a good job of controlling the speed, and I find that it is very quiet.  I don't have any problems with it, and it's not going to hurt my head.  I'm very happy with the motor.  I just wish it had a bit bigger to hold it.  It's a very quiet unit.  The motor is very quiet, and I find it very quiet. "

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Testing this as a free product from the Amazon Vine program.
Space age looking, and heavier than most standard claw hammers, but easy to use and swing with less shock than a wooden or straight plastic handled hammer.
Like others I have noticed some nicks and scratches after very little uses so suggest the steel is a little softer than it should be maybe.
At nearly $50 this hammer is almost 3 times more expensive than the Estwing steel shaft 16 oz claw hammer, over 2.5 times as much as the excellent Stanley 51-163 16-Ounce FatMax Xtreme AntiVibe Rip Claw Nailing Hammer, and around six times more than a standard hickory handled or fibreglass Stanley. Aside from the magnetic nail channel (great feature) I don't see a huge amount to justify the price. It does have a lifetime warranty, but then again it should at the price. I was generous and gave it 4 stars."

I will post review updates as this product ages."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"My Mom asked me to go to the local store and I did. This is the first one I've owned.  The plastic parts are very sturdy, and the cover is very sturdy.  The blades are very sharp, and the handles are very comfortable.  I love the fact that they don't come with a handle.  I can use the handle with a knife if needed.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a knife that won't break if you want to sharpen it.I bought this as a gift for my son who loves to cook.  It was a gift for my son who was a huge fan of my cookbook.  The reason I got this was to make my son cook for me and he loves to cook for me.  My son loves to cook with me.  I was going to buy a second set of this because I really like the color and the finish of the books.  It's a really nice quality book.  I just wish it had a darker background.  I love that it has a small red tag that says ""Made in USA.""  I would also like that it has a description for the book that says ""Made in China.""  I also like that it has a nice green color.  It is really nice to have an accent that makes my son feel like he's a real person.  It is a perfect addition to my kitchen.  I also like that the book has a sharp edge that makes it easier to cut with ease.  It is very easy to read and works well.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good cookbook.  This is a very good product"

They all match, they were cheap to purchase & operate, arrived as promised & well packaged. I will be replacing more throughout the house & definitely from this seller. Can't say enough about how pleased I am.  Only tip is that if screwed in snugly & they don't come on, loosening them some works.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"The presentation of this towel really does not do justice to the product. What turns out to be a remarkably good towel arrived looking at first glance like a small lightweight and inexpensive item, but upon using this product, I discovered a VERY absorbent yet lightweight towel and hand towel set. At first glance this set, (I will mainly address the bath towel) looked rather small and lacked volume compared to the average folded towel, but that turns out to be an advantage. My initial disappointment turned to intrigue as I unfolded the generously sized towel, a soft, lightweight and attractive looking bath sheet. What truly amazed me though, is how I could fold the towel down to such a small size that it would easily fit in a suitcase pocket. My next test was to use it after washing my hair. I was amazed at how absorbent it was, drawing excess water from my hair without becoming water logged. The fact that it also dried quickly sealed the deal--this is my new travel towel!
  I love trying out new products, and the temptation took over when I was offered a discount coupon to use in exchange for my hones review. I purchased the blue, and found it to be a lovely and soothing hue very much like the one pictured. I'm glad I tried it,  and I like it!

I have had them for a few years now and they are awesome.  I have tried to keep them on my truck because of the size of the light, but they are too small for the small size.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This caddy is really solid and well made. I had an old metal one that I tossed in favor of this one. I have bamboo cutting boards and since I know bamboo stands up well to water, this was an easy purchase for me. It does not fit over my soaking tub and isn't adjustable, but fits in my standard tub in my guest bath. It gives the guest bath a spa-type feel. It can be used on a dresser or counter top in addition to the tub. It's spacious and securely holds wine glasses. If this had rubber grips for on the edge of the tub, I'd rate it 5 stars, but overall I really like it."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"My pig/cow obsession started while I was in cosmetology school, and I was searching for timers that didn't look the same as every other student. It has carried on to this day, and I still have a love for unique little items like this, that I don't see anyone else having.
These little big salt and pepper shakers are really cute, and well made. They easily stand on their own and make such a cute little set!
The noses come off to allow the inside to be filled, and the opening was large enough that filling them was very easy.
The silicone noses are brightly colored and although they are easy to remove when you want to, they DONT slide off any other time. To remove, you simply slide a fingernail under the side and peel it up.
I was a little hesitant about the size of the holes. I feel like they could be made just a tiny bit bigger, BUT I personally have 2 kids and DO appreciate that they can use these without worrying about them dumping too much seasoning on their food. If I decide to widen the holes then I know it will be easy because of the silicone.
I have put these through the dishwasher with no issue, although I do not plan (or really foresee a need) to do it again.

All in all, these little piggy shakers are a really adorable little set, and very well made. They made a great addition to my kitchen and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking to replace any other boring salt and pepper shakers!

Surely the manufacturer understood that these pans would be used at high temps etc and the appearance should not change after two uses.  Also the instructions said to wash before use and oil.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This has been working very well for us. We got a new house recently that had some musty smells in the closet built off the master bedroom's attached bathroom. The prior owners had obviously not done a good job ventilating or keeping moisture controlled. I put one of these in there, and have been keeping the door closed except when going in or out. After a week, the air has changed dramatically, and you can even feel the dryness of the air when you open the door. I would heed the warnings here, and put a pan under the bucket though, jut in case the plastic does break, but I think that is more likely if it is exposed to direct sunlight in a high heat situation, like in a car sitting out in the sun. But still, better safe than sorry.

First complaint was there were no installation instructions included. Even the website didn't offer any help, offering just an email to contact.

Second, this was apparently designed to be attached directly to the ceiling and not to a ceiling electrical box as it did not come with the right parts. The cover for the ceiling was also barely big enough to cover the standard-size box I had. After messing around with extra screws and brackets, I did manage to get it installed quite nicely, no thanks to the included accessories.

Third, the set screw that you tighten down to hold the cord in the lamb base is nylon and stripped out with almost no pressure.

Overall, it looks fantastic, but the installation procedure was ridiculous."

This is a good utility skillet for frying or cooking larger quantities of food. The better-designed Calphalon Contemporary see-through lid sits on the pan just right, and lets you check the progress of your food while sealing in flavor (and trapping aromas). (The less times you open the lid = better and faster cooking.) The silicone cover to the lid handle is a stroke of brilliance.

This pan also comes with an insulated silicone handle cover, which used to be an accessory item. Chalk that up as a value-add.

Cleanup is easy, just scrub out with warm water, mild soap and a nylon brush. Wipe dry and stow away.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,How can anyone go wrong with this?  It is a great product for the price. It is so small that it is not portable.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I had mild expectations for this product, after all it was just a toilet set right?  I was pleasantly surprised as they way the seat attaches to the bowl is unique and allows for easy removal for cleaning.  I like that!  The only issue is that the seat is so glossy it shows every fingerprint and water spot.  Maybe it will degloss some overtime."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,"Much smaller than I expected, and has the same feel. I will keep this in the tool box. I bought this to replace the Schlage 32-60-8 bulb that I replaced with this one. It works great, and the size is perfect. I used it for the lighting in my family's room and it has a very low output (just a little over 10 watts). It does not have a flashing light on it, but it does have a very bright light. I would recommend this bulb to anyone. I love these lamps. They are brighter than my old ceiling fan but still work great. I love the way the light is dimmed, but I like the fact that I can see them in the dark. I like the fact that they are 3/4 inch thick, which is nice. I would recommend them to anyone. My only complaint is that the handle is a little too large for my use. I bought a small set and it is a bit larger than expected. I think it's a design flaw. I have not used it yet, but it is working perfectly. This is the only one I have that will work with the Samsung SmartThings hub."

I had to rush my german shepherd to the vet the other day and didn't have enough time to cover the car seats.  Consequently, every seat in the car was literally covered in fur.  I used the Bissell Pet Hair Eraser Handheld Vacuum this morning and within one hour my car looked new inside again.

This is one of the better ones and it's around my usual mid-range price point.  The Havana (tobacco) scent is fabulous and unisex; my fiance says it's not an offensive scent, which is a compliment coming from him.  It burns cleanly and evenly from one side of the container to the other.  It doesn't have the best reach like a $60+ candle, but it's better than cheaper candles, and worth it for the pleasant scent.  If you're in the same room you can definitely smell it.  I would consider buying again (even though I'm continuatlly looking for a new scent)!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"There are a ton of reviews on this product already, 275 of which are five stars so I'm sure I'm not going to say anything that hasn't already been said but the utility of this tool deserves praise. For $7 I can't imagine a better use of money for the usefulness you get out of it. For about the same price as a few Chalupa Supremes from TacoBell you can have the Gerber Shard. If you just use this as a bottle opener it easily pays for itself in terms of connivence not having to search for one or ask around when you want a brew. On top of that its got a decent pry bar, your thumb fits nicely allowing for a fair amount of leverage. The screw drivers actually make for quick and easy option for small jobs when you just don't feel like breaking out the tool box. The tool itself its light and thin which makes carrying it no different than adding another key to your key ring. Bottom line I don't know anyone who wouldn't benefit from adding one of these too their EDC."

Works great with my powertec hose though."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,The one's we received had the green light button on the right not the left as pictured.  Which turns out is exactly what we wanted.  So the picture seems to be mirrored left to right.  Works great though.  If you plan on using several you might want to make a chart of how you set the four dip switches.  When I was testing my handy work I switched the light on and off several times than sat down to rest.  The light then began flashing on and off on its own.  I was confused until my son came upstairs and told me his light was turning on and off.  Only then I realized I set both to the same code accidentally so it was turning on and off both lights.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,product is very thin and doesn't support the weight. I will keep my old one but the extra space is not the best.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Seems like such a small little bathroom gadget couldn't bring so much joy but you would be wrong. Nothing worse than a bar of soap all gunky in the shower. I bought this to put on one of my shelves in my new shower and it's awesome, the soap doesn't get gunky and lasts a lot longer. Love it! The only thing I worry about is possibly bumping into it and breaking it, maybe in the future design they should consider a little suction cup on the base."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I bought this light not knowing what to expect so from the beginning:  Packing was great; the light arrives in a hard case that has fitted inserts that hold everything in place safely and comfortably, no hassle getting charger, light, and strap in and out. Next, accessories that come with the light, besides the hard case, the light comes with everything you need for getting started I especially like the shoulder strap that it comes with, the light is larger and heavier than I expected and when Im working with it for extended periods of time it starts to get heavy. The flashlight comes with attachment points for the shoulder strap so they thought that part out well. The light itself is brighter than some construction site wobble lights Ive used and is capable of lighting up entire room(s) by just standing it up in the middle of the room and letting the light bounce of the ceiling and walls which is very impressive. Outside, the light throws out a powerful beam that (I use it in a pitch dark 5 acre property) is the best that Ive experienced. Thank goodness the flashlight has three light settings, I use the middle setting most of the time but its great to have options. Finally, the flashlight has a battery indicator that really comes in handy so I don't get caught short of charge."

Overall This is a good product. I got the orange one for my daughter room. Its super cute. But BE AWARE - Read the description and see the actual picture for the size. It is pretty small. I actually put it on the table instead of hanging it. It just too small to put it on the wall. It look awkward.

The watch made from plastic and has a lightweight.... Which it meant cheap but i like for kid room because if it fell or drop, It won't hurt my little girl. Also its a plastic for it won't shatter. This watch is simple and cute. It comes with AA battery.  Another thing i like about this watch is the number. It is large and i can see it across the room which it helps at nighttime feeding.

The navy isn't too dark, so it does look like a true navy and matches nicely with other decor. Im not sure Id put this in a high traffic area, but it works well for a bedroom. It had a new carpet smell for a few days, but it quickly went away."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Most travel pillows Id previously used were simply okay; the THERMATEK HEATED TRAVEL PILLOW is one of the most relaxing, comfortable travel pillows Ive ever used.

WHAT IT IS:

- A U-shaped pillow that fits around the neck for support with the optional benefit of heat.

WHAT MAKES IT SO SPECIAL:

- Memory foam with a silky-soft/plush cover.  The memory-foam pad is somewhat firm and provides added comfort and support. Extremely comfortable/cozy and accommodates larger necks.  The pillow itself isn't tapered like most pillows, its slab-like thickness adds more support.

- There is a pocket/sleeve that accepts disposable heat packs.  This is an added benefit for those who are seeking a therapeutic angle to their travel pillow.  The pillow comes with 2 disposable heat packs; additional heat packs must be purchased separately.

I found this pillow to be quite luxurious and useful.  The pillow alone (no heat) is great to use when working at the computer, watching television, reading and travel.  The memory foam and plush cover make this pillow comfortable to use for longer periods than the other travel pillows Id previously tried.  While I like the soothing option of heat, the added cost of buying additional replacement heat packs must be considered (each pack generates about 8 hours of warmth) will temper my need for heat.  Heat or no heat, the THERMATECK HEATED TRAVEL PILLOW is wonderful."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Recommended by a woodworking pro and I agree.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,CG,I bought this unit because it has the same combo as the one I replaced. I have one in my bathroom and the other in the garage. The garage is a little darker and it's difficult to see in the hallway. I would recommend it.I bought this to replace a broken one I had.  I love the color and the fact that the hose is a little longer than the one I had.  I installed the new one on my new showerhead and it works great.  I had to twist the old one out a little bit to get it to fit.  I'm glad I did.  I have used it a couple of times and it seems to be working just fine.I'm a professional woodworker and this is my first one to install a new shower head
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,PROS:  tried this wanting to say it was a good flashlight but it didn't work. I bought two of the same. I also bought the T20 version of this flashlight that I have had in the past. The T20 version is very compact and gives you a great light. I have also tried the T20 version with the T40 and T40-6 and I have had them both work as well as the T40-6. I have not used the T20 version yet but I have tried the T20 version with the T40-6 and it has worked great. The T40-6 is not as bright as the T20 version but it is still bright enough to see if something is behind the counter. I had a few of these flashlights that I have tried but the T40-6 is very good for this kind of flashlight. I have had two of these flashlights that I have used for a few years and they are very good.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Very nice desktop DVM with a really nice bright display.  Probes are superb.  Well-packaged and well-made but quite heavy, presumably due to large power transformer inside.  Printed literature is minimal;  the actual operating manual is provided in PDF form on a CD.  There is hardly any information provided on how to use the unit for more advanced purposes like integrating it into a LabVIEW system; you'll have to dig elsewhere for that.

The only negative I have on this is that my unit was shipped with a 110VAC power cord as expected but the unit itself was set to 220VAC.  Kind of funny that the certificate of calibration traces back to a Fluke product!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I'm in a new house, and trying to keep to my resolutions of being organized. You know all those little things you have around the house? In the bathroom, the office, the kitchen? This, and the other sizes, are all great for corralling them up and keeping them from looking junky.

I'm using one of these to keep my diabetes equipment - testing, syringes, etc. Before, I kept them in an old tupperware, and they'd always get jumbled up in the bottom. Now my syringes are standing up, my oral meds are in a slot, and the whole thing slides neatly into a cabinet.

I've got one in my office, too, holding all the things that aren't pens - little styluses, nail files, computer screwdrivers, etc. In my bathroom, one's holding tweezers, manicure scissors and little samples of perfume in 1 cubby.

The nice thing is, even though I have 2 of them tucked into cabinets, they're good looking enough that I don't mind keeping them on a counter or desk."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I had never made lollipops but always wanted to. I have gotten into trying to make many new recipes and foods in the last few years and thought this would be fun so I placed my order for the mold.

The set comes with one mold and one set of sticks. If you want to make them again you would have to purchase more sticks. Our local hobby store sells them and you can order them online. The mold itself can be used in the freezer, microwave, and oven. It is also dishwasher safe;; however I could not test that as I do not own a dishwasher.

The mold does not come with any type of recipe for creating lollipops. If you look online however you can find many recipes for free. The mold only has a spot for a dozen to be made at once. For a family the size of mine, I would need to make several batches. It would be easier to have a larger set of molds or to purchase multiple sets.

The molds do not require spray as the pan is silicone and nonstick. They are easy to clean and since they are silicone and small and easy to store. I am looking forward to trying many new recipes with this mold.

That being said, I like this appliance for what it is, an electric pressure cooker. I found myself like most folks on here, not sure of how to use it, as the 'cookbook' that came with it was pretty much just a few recipes. I did find a wonderful pressure cooker cookbook here on Amazon, and I would suggest you purchase something along these lines. This author has been using electric pressure cooking for years, and her book is full of helpful hints, and tons of recipes. I have found it to be invaluable. Just even in the rice section. I was at a loss with the instructions that came with, but in this book, it's all perfectly laid out. The book is available here on Amazon 'hip pressure cooking'. If you are wanting to get the most use out of your newly purchased appliance, you would do yourself a favor and pick up something similar to this book to go along with it. http://www. amazon."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This is a fairly nifty multifunction gadget for any golfer, and would make a nice inexpensive gift. As a divot repair tool this is solidly built and works OK. It also has a magnetic ball marker that slides off when you press the bottom of it (it has a 19th hole logo, which you can have replaced with team logos or other options offered by the manufacturer). The top end features an indent to hold a club, just above the magnet designed to catch bottle caps pulled off by the bottle opener (flip it over to use as a can opener). The 6th use of this is to hold cigars, something I would not use myself but which I suppose some golfers may have use for. This tool is nice to have and it is solid, so it should offer many years of use as long as you don't lose it. The shiny gold finish may not last, but while it does it will make the tool stand out in the green. One thing I do suggest is that Amazon place this in the sporting category rather than home goods, where it is currently listed. While it opens bottles and cans, the main purpose is divot repair, which people would search for in sporting goods."

This particular unit has a 7 gallon capacity, a glass-lined tank, and a recovery rate of almost 7 gallons per hour.

In my review video I cover the main features and issues with this water heater, but briefly:

This 7-gallon heater is large! The dimensions are 17.5 W x 17.5 H x 14.5 D. This was too large to install in our bathrooms or kitchen, so we had to install this in our basement crawlspace.

Also keep in mind that the unit itself weighs about 30 pounds, and with the extra weight of 7 gallons of water, the total weight of the heater will be almost 90 pounds. We set the heater on cement blocks to make a firm foundation.

Hooking up the plumbing to the unit is relatively straightforward, though in our case, because we installed the unit in our basement, we had to tap into the hot water run.  But this location would also not cause any house damage if the unit leaked.

Hooking up the electricity was more difficult, since we had to hire an electrician to make a hard-wired 12A and 120V connection the heater needs.

We are happy with this unit. The time it takes to get hot water is much shorter than it used to be, and seven gallons is enough of a reserve that we don't deplete it before our main hot water heater kicks in.

So all in all we have been very happy with this Bosch water heater, though again keep in mind the size and weight limitations of the 7-gallon unit.

I hope this review has been helpful!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I finally picked up the black version off of Woot for a great price. The lack of a flipper had put me off for years because I have sliced my thumb using the thumbstuds on 2 other Ken Onion blades I own. I should have just trusted all the good reviews because this has to be the best knife on the market under $100.00. It's certainly the best knife Kershaw makes and I have a dozen of them to compare it to. It's almost perfect, extremely light, very comfortable to both carry and hold, flies open like a bat out of hell and locks up like a tank. It became my edc immediately and I just ordered the olive version so now I have 2. I'm sure I will get the s30v version as well, not that there is anything wrong with the sandvic. Some people have pointed out that the liner lock looks a little thin, and it does, but I haven't had any issues with it and don't anticipate any. If any improvement could be made on this knife in my opinion it would be to make it a beefy frame lock with a lock bar stabilizer. They could use a titanium frame, elmax blade, slap the ZT logo on it and get $200.00 for it all day. I'd buy 2 of those as well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I ordered one of these curious about the comparison to the Honeywell product.  If you haven't noticed (by reading the reviews) this is not the same product that Honeywell delivers with their air filtration unit.

The filter that came with my unit was a bit stiffer in construction when compared to this replacement filter but, I'm fairly confident that this replacement will provide similar performance.  It is identically sized, and seems to have the same filtration capabilities (or darn close) to the actual Honeywell product.

I'll order this again, and feel confident in suggesting that you give it a chance."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I can enter my parking garage using a key, or remotely using the garage door opener (I have a 3089 10-pin opener).  Since entering is easier via the remote door, I was hoping to find a small remote that I could fit into my pocket so that I could keep the main opener in the car, and use the smaller one as a key.

I was a bit skeptical that this little device would work, but it works perfectly.  You just open it up, program the pins, and it's good to go. I've only tested the range from ~ 2 car lengths (b/c that's all I need) but from that range it works flawlessly.

I had to drill a hole in the bottom of the plastic housing to take it out. I used a little bit of tape to secure the driver. This was easy to do. The only thing I found that was a bit

It's really tricky when the pan is hot.  If I had known this I probably would have went with a different brand that had this option, but at the time of ordering I didn't realize how much easier it would really be."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,"Slow drains?  I've always had an electric bill, and I'm not happy with the way the water is treated.  The water tastes like crap, and if you don't get it right it's going to get in the way of your work.  This is a problem that should be fixed.  I have a portable sink, which can be attached to the sink, and the water is just filthy.  I'm not sure if it will be able to hold up to the heat, but I don't think the water tastes like crap, and I don't think it's going to drain well.  I would have liked to have been able to have a portable sink for less money, but this isn't a problem.I bought these to replace my old faucets and they are great!  I have used them for almost a month now and they are well made and have a very good feel to them.  I have used a good deal of other brands as well and they are great!  I have used them for a number of years now and they are very well made and seem to be very strong.  I would recommend them to anyone!

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I was pleasantly surprised with these coveralls. I was hoping the would not be super thin material and easy to zip. I was not let down! I love how everything is connect, these are not 3 separate pieces. Just ONE piece, so easy to just slide the booties over your shoes, then pull up the coveralls, zip to desired area, and hoodie over head. I use this during a deep purge of a house with lots of dust, dander and allergens."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,"I bought two of these and both work fine. I will keep one for the other one. I bought this to replace the Schlage 32-60-8 bulb that I replaced with this one. It works great, but it is not as bright as the old one. I have to use a larger diameter bulb, which is a lot better. It has more of a fluorescent look, but I like the look more. I like that the bulb is longer than the old one, which is nice. I use the same bulb twice a day, and use it daily. It is more of a ""screwdriver"" type of light. The reason I like this bulb is because it has a longer diameter, which makes it easier to carry around. Also, the light is pretty bright, so I'm happy with the light. I don't really like the color of the bulb, but it is pretty cool. I bought a couple of these for my son's bedroom. He loves it. He loves the way it lights up his room. I'm very happy with the size of this light."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,These are really cool actually.  My boyfriend loved them.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I bought it because the stainless steel would hold far fewer bacteria than a plastic turkey baster. However, this doesn't hold suction well.  Liquid (wine in this case) doesn't just drip out... It RUNS out.  I am able to work around it by quickly tilting it back to retain some liquid.  I wanted to try to avoid using a glass thief as it would probably be broken by my clumsiness. I see there are plastic thiefs out.  Guess I will just have to get one and replace them from time to time to avoid contaminants."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,The rag was as shown in the pictures. The colors and sizing were very accurate. It matched perfectly with my living room.

I have one other saw that I had to replace, but that is the only one I have.I have used this product in the past. I am very pleased.I bought this to replace a broken one I had.  I have the most beautiful, beautiful, and well built shower head I have ever seen.  This one has a nice, sleek design,"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"So I've had my Wagner Steamer for 2 days and I am wondering how I ever lived without it. It is amazing. I have parrots and it has made cleaning their cages a snap with no harsh chemicals. I also have about 1,200 sq. ft. of tile on my first floor (cream grout--what was I thinking). It have cleaned the grout to almost new. It also took out a stain in my carpet that the carpet cleaners were even unable to remove....woo hoo...now I have this lovely clean spot in my carpet in the middle of the hallway..LOL. It has cleaned everything I've put it to (candle wax out of cloth, grease out of stove vents, gum out of particle board). The only thing it didn't remove completely was red paint from my son's jeans--well I had to try. I can't wait to try it on removing wallpaper.

Regarding the cons I have read:
Noise Level: if noise bothers you invest in some good ear plugs. It didn't bother me at all though and I've been a steaming maniac for oh almost 24 hours total.
Doesn't work like promised: Well if you expect perfection you will always be disappointed I am afraid. I have not been disappointed one bit in mine.

Recommendations:
Buy yourself a good pair of knee pads--you will need them.
Buy extra nozzles. If you are going to use yours as much as I am using mine you will need the extra nylon nozzles. I've already worn one of the nozzles down half way...yes I've been using my machine A LOT!!

Pros:
What can I say...you would be nuts not to get one. That is if it is something that you think you will use on a weekly basis. If not buy one for a good friend that you know will use it all the time as a Christmas or birthday present and borrow it...LOL."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,I got this gauge for my wife and she loves it.  She also loves the way the gauge is so precise.  I am using it for the instruction sheet on a 4x4.  It is very precise.  I think it is going to be a great tool for the money.  I have used it for 3-4 hours and it is very strong.  I have used it on a small wire stripper and on a 3-4 wire cutter and it is strong.  I am going to use it for any project that I may need it for.  It will be a great tool for the money. 
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"UPDATE: I believe this vacuum is now going on 4 years old and still works like a champ. Had to replace the filter twice in that timeframe, but it shows no signs of slowing down. Probably go on for another 4 years.

I'll keep it short:

No more bags.  I have only had to buy a replacement filter once since buying it over 2 years ago.  We did a side by side comparison of another upright vacuum, and this pulled more dirt and more pet hair out of the carpet than the other one.  Not by a little bit, but by a huge amount.  I vacuumed the house before sending the other vacuum back.  Then immediately vacuumed the house again: it looked as though I never vacuumed it with the other vacuum; the lint bucket was full.

I hope this lasts 15 more years, because I never want to use another vacuum.

Oh, I did have to go out and buy a bristle brush attachment."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"After reading the reviews, I was hesitant to order the Revolution.  I watched some of the YouTube video reviews and was a little more encouraged.  I ordered it from Amazon because they had the cheapest price, and I know they have hassle free returns if needed.  The saw arrived today and after unboxing it I am impressed.  It showed up without any damage, and was set to go right out of the box.  Took all of two minutes to put together.  I do agree that the hold down clamps are cheap, but I don't really need them so not a big deal.  The blade was square and true right out of the box.  I am only using it to cut metal and the couple test cuts I did were no problem.  For the money, it beats the metal chop saw that is slow and leaves way to many burrs.  This saw did not leave any burrs.  I will update in a month or two and let you know how things are working.  But so far, would recommend it.

Update:  I have been using the saw for a few months now and love it.  I cuts clean, burr-free, and with little spark.  The laser guide is dead on and makes cutting miters a breeze.  I sold my Dewalt abrasive saw and don't miss it one bit.  The blade still cuts like butter even after months of constant use.  I use it only for cutting metal and would highly recommend!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"My wife and I have an historic condo in a circa 1890's building - a truly lovely period place with high ceilings, wide moldings, huge pocket doors, marble fireplaces, wood floors, etc.  it cries out for period-piece furniture and ""atmosphere"" consistent with it's heritage.  We both love candles, but they have their drawbacks, from real flames in an older buidling (not a good combination) to dripping, wick-cleaning, etc.  Nevertheless, they are worth the effort.  When saw these I had to have them.  First, they look EXACTLY like real wax candles - and even kind of feel ""waxy"" (although they are not made of wax). And the electric ""candle"" light is authentic - and can be adjusted from just ""on"" to a ""flickering"" real candle effect.  And, best of all, you get a small remote control that you can use to turn them on, turn them off, and set an automatic timer to keep them on for 4 hours, 8 hours, or 24 hours, after which they will turn off.  They run on inexpensive batteries, which last forever, and put out zero heat - no fire hazard.  And, the look and light and flicking is incredible.  The only thing you don't get is a scent - but then again there are other ways to get that besides candles.  We love them, and the price is great.  Highly recommend."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"It's an okay water pump for me but my wife doesn't really like it. The reason is when she presses the top it gets stuck and by the time she gets it unstuck, the pump has lost the vacuum pressure. She suffers from carpal tunnel so the amount of force required exceeds what she can apply sometimes.
I've seen it the way she uses the pump and I realized that it does required rapid force applied correctly at the pump. If you apply force say at one side then the pump gets stuck.
Another example was from my parents trying to press the pump with their fingers instead of the palm of the hand, I always have to remind them to use the palm.
Update: it has started to squeak when pressed down, bummer I thought this would last longer. Down to two stars."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,I have tried several of these and the quality is just as good as my old one. The suction cup is a nice feature. The suction cups are great for storing rice or pasta. It takes a little more effort to get the rice to form the shape that you want it to. I do wish it had a plastic base instead of a plastic/metal one. It does hold a lot of stuff and it is easy to clean. I'm very happy with this purchase. These are great. I love that they are made of fiberglass. I am really happy with this purchase. They are not as thick as I had hoped but I like that they are a bit thicker. I would recommend them to anyone who wants a quality product. I love this little bag. I have a small kitchen and my bag keeps food from drying out.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,"Got this on sale for $8.00 and it works great.  The only thing that is a little off is the plastic part.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"In an attempt to save some money by eating out less, I went on a quest for the best way to bake a frozen pizza (which puts me back $5 vs the $20 for takeout).
I am not a fan of placing the frozen pizza directly on the oven rack.  The hassle of having to remove and wash the rack after each use (as well having to clean the cheese that drips off onto the oven floor) made this a non-option.
Pizza sheets for baking result in a soggy crust.
I tried a ceramic pizza stone and precisely followed the directions of preheating then placing the frozen pizza onto it for baking.  The outer edges were nice and crispy but the center was always soggy.  Also any cheese that got onto the stone was an ordeal to wash off.
Then I saw this baking rack... I did follow the advice of previous reviews and measured my baking sheet to make sure it fit.  I also line the baking sheet with some foil for easy clean up.  This was the perfect solution!!!  The frozen pizzas turn out evenly cooked and no soggy middle!!  In the time it takes to call a restaurant then drive out to pick up the pizza (or have it delivered), I can have one made for 1/4 the price (and serve it piping hot directly from the oven) at home!!!
I also made some baked sweet potato fries on this rack and they turned out great too!!!  Only advice is to not overload it or the fries will not evenly cook."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"I bought this in hopes that it would stay lit... after all, it is called ""Windfighter"". I followed the directions exactly. Well, I think they really need to change the name, because it kept blowing out today every time there was a slight breeze. I believe the design is the defect. Even bucket candles stay lit better than this -- the reason being that a bucket candle's wick is much lower. This ""Windfighter"" has a raised wick. And despite the metal top (that keeps falling off when you move or carry it, because it does not screw on or anything), the wind can just blow right through the holes and extinguish the flame. Another issue with this... when it was lit, it was producing some pretty heavy black soot/smoke. YUK! I can still feel it in my lungs! lol  I bought 3 of these, unfortunately, and feel like I wasted money, because I am going back to my old bucket candles that stay lit better and do not make black smoke."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I bought only two of these bulbs for testing in my RV trailer.  They work well, and give off plenty of light compared to the old incandescent lamps, with virtually none of the heat generated by the former.  My only complaint is that the wedge base seems a 'leetle bit loose' in my trailer lamps, and I have to be sure that they're well and fully inserted.  I've not yet taken the unit out on the road and subjected it to the vibration of highway travel, so the jury is still out on this subject.
As usual with my Amazon orders, the acquisition was virtually painless and packaging from the vendor was compact, effective, and prompt.
I'm well satisfied and will probably buy more of these led's in the future."

I am very pleased with it.This is a great product for the price. It works well, but I wish it was more sturdy. I just wish it had a more sturdy lid."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Love it. Cleans  easily. Love it. Love it.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,Effective gentle light which is perfect for the job.  I will keep this in the tool box.I bought this to replace the Schlage 32-60-8 bulb
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I have had mine for Two Years now. I have had no problems. I believe the company states 3-4 second response time.?.....Mine seems to work much faster than that.
I mostly use mine for photography. Chemicals for Color Photography are rather critical...not as much with Black and White...but the more consistent the better. I have had mine in my darkroom for a bit over two years now, it has worked fine. I have checked it against my Kodak Thermometer, and some rather expensive Industrial/Scientific thermometers, and this thing is pretty close. For 25 bux, it is a good deal."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This is perfect. I wish I would have ordered it earlier.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Love this pan. Purchased this pan because I needed something that would keep my cheese hot and stayed hot longer.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,Sturdy set!  The color is a nice medium-dark pink.  The opener is strong and sturdy.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,Was really looking forward to this steam mop what a disappointment.  Does not work on high steam.  The steam fresh attachment does not stay attached.  Would like to return but now that it is assembled the handle cannot be unattached.  Don't buy this product keep shopping for one that totally works.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"This may doesn't stick to the counter, but it is a good deal for a small kitchen."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I needed a larger tea kettle and liked the looks of this one. I was changing for another reason also, that the handle became very hot when it was used so I was hoping for a handle that remained cooler. However, this is not the case, but I still like its looks and just use a potholder when boiling water for tea."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Saved a few $ by choosing the Amazon Warehouse Deals option and selecting a ""used like new.""  My mug was indeed brand new, maybe a return in which someone didn't like the color.  Personally, I love the Latte color and it is not as brown looking as in the picture but is just a tint darker than the natural stainless finish.  Most importantly this mug is all it is advertised as.  Keeps coffee hot all day, and with no worry of leaking.  It's also easy to clean.  If you want the finish and vacuum to hold up though you MUST hand wash the bottom container part.  The top is dishwasher safe though.  This is a really sturdy mug but if I ever need to replace it I'll be looking to buy another one, I'm also thinking these make for nice gifts for my coffee and tea drinking friends."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Sturdy,  holds all my Camis and makes them easy to access."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,CG,"I ordered these blades to replace an older one that was too large. They are strong and sturdy. I had to replace a larger version with the same blades. I used these blades to replace an older one that was too large. This one is still very sharp. I have used them with a German 9mm wrenches and the one I received was a bit larger. I will order another one for my wife. Great item!Works well, not very strong for a small tool."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,I have used many variations of this saw.  The best is the one that I own and use frequently.  This saw is a solid and reliable saw.  It is very reliable and it is well made.  The only problem I have is the blade is a bit short for the saw.  I have to order it from a different source

We bought 2 of these and they are so perfect for our car. I use them to heat up the stove top. I have a large freezer and I can use the microwave to heat up the top. I just put the stove top on the stove and use it as an oven to heat"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Great drying rack. Fits in my laundry room. Great quality.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the mesh filter is so large that it is not a very good filter"

Ive order towels to match color in shower curtain 3 times and theyve been either hot piink or horrible texture."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"People beware!  First off, this is NOT an oil stove.  It is a small, inexpensive, and extremely small, dishwasher safe pan.  The plastic lid on the handle is made of metal and it is not waterproof.  The pan is not made to last.  The only way to put it together is to leave it in the dishwasher and put a paper towel in it to dry it. "

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"If you can lift furniture high enough to get this product under it, you can lift it high enough to put a furniture slider under it.  I guess if you have some furniture that has a lip on it...  I found it worthless for the furniture I was trying to move.  I am a 49 yr of female who was helping my parents (mid to late 70s) move some office furniture in order to paint a room.  Since there was no lip, I just barely lifted the furniture enough for them to slide a furniture sliders underneath each corner.  I returned this for refund- it was useless to me."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Saved me a grip of this tool and the tools in the toolbox that I have been using. I bought this to replace the Schlage 32-60-8 bulb that I replaced with this one. It works great, and the size is perfect."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a very nice set of dishes, and you can store them all in the lunch container. I took it to lunch today and I really like the plates.  Only they are not spill proof really.  Today my bag was soaked and I just cleaned it when I came home.  Ready to go again for another day."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Get the 8 inch, unless you specifically need a 6"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Sweet knife. Fit and finish was spot on. blade was centered and strait in the handle when closed. Opening is smooth and easy. Lock up with liner lock is tight with no play in any direction. Pretty dang sharp out of the box. That being said, the edge is very fine and I rolled about a third of it over in the middle of the blade just dinking around the house with it to get used to it. A quick hone and a few strokes on the strop brought it back easily. I'll update stars and review after I get some time in on it out in the field.

It should be noted that this thing is pretty large for an EDC/utility knife. It's heavy for it's size as well, largely due to the solid stainless liners. The blade is broad, but the flat grind mitigates that a bunch.

Update - So, I've had this thing a while now and it's been a great blade. I would dock half a star if I could due to the blade having lost it's centering when folded. It now rubs a bit on the liner, though it's not enough to hinder the opening of the knife. I carry it daily and use it daily as well. I feel like I've done anything out of bounds to get the blade to off center like it has. I take care of my gear. That all being said, it's still reliable and a great performer. It holds the edge well and is easy to touch up in the field with my pocket hone. I still recommend this knife and have bought the Rat II and am waiting on a D2 version the the Rat I. Go get one today!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This was a two day project to put together.  We stopped the first night after an hour or so when we saw how slow it was going to come together.  My husband had to make holes larger in the metal parts in certain places because it wouldn't go together otherwise.  We sweated it out, and it was a pretty unpleasant experience.  Generally my hubby can make ANYTHING work, and he did with this, but lets just say you better start off as a happy couple beforehand because this thing was a b*tch.  Now that it's all done, sitting sturdily, I might add, in our entryway, we're thrilled.  We really like how it looks, the two of us can sit on it at the same time, we hang everything up there, leashes, coats, basket of bandannas on the top shelf, shoes on the bottom, sunglasses up top, you name it.  Very handy.  I think it was like 20 bucks cheaper the week after we bought it, but I wasn't too upset because it is a nice quality piece.  Recommended if you can be patient, and you have more tools on hand than what it comes with."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Fits beside the leather recliner and is perfect to hold the remotes, the coaster for the beer and on occasion, the phone.  Inside there are the normal things a man considers essential for his survival, extra paper towels (for spills), sharpening stones for his pocket knife, extra batteries for the remotes, and other things unknown to this wife.  Considering another for my chair.  It is just about an inch below the top of the chair's arm.  Makes it nearly perfect.  The shelf below works great for holding the boots after they come off for the night.  It went together easily, didn't have any trouble with the bottom shelf as others have reported.  But then, this is not my first construction project.  Was simple after making sure all the parts were there, reading the instructions (mostly pictures) and taking my time."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"This stuff is  the worst quality I ever had. I am a sider (construction worker), and it last about two hours , before it get holes..

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,love it  it is so cute in my new bathroom
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,We have two of these lights. The one we have is a GFCI style dimmer. It's not very bright but it's good enough to light up a room in a dark room. I have two of these in my bed. I have one on my door and another on my door. I have two dimmer lights in the house and one in the garage. They are dimmable but I can see them dim if I go too far away from the light. The other light is a light bulb. The light bulb is dimmable but it is bright enough to light a room in a dark room.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"Purchased these as a bundle with a black light flashlight.  They work well thou they don't fit over my fat head very well.  Have put these over the lenses of the black light when on a florescent stain and they do block enough that you cant see the stain any longer.  Have also discovered that having these on stops my Transitions lenses from darkening when outside.  Not blown away since they don't fit over my head well, but they do exactly what is advertised."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"This is not a joke: this is the only one I've used.

The only downside is that it's very dimmable, which is not the case with the Kohler bulbs.

The Kohler bulbs are designed to last a very long time. I find that most people don't realize how long they will last, but the last bulb on my Nest thermostat will last a very long time. That's not to say that they don't last very long, but it's not to say that the Kohler bulbs last too long.

The design of the Kohler bulbs is very well designed. They look great, and they do"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Exactly as described.  I love that you can rekey it yourself.  I would definitely buy again.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I ordered this for my husband...he loves the set...especially the noodle strainer:)
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"With growing pains always on the prowl, my daughter can have trouble sleeping at night. Providing the most comfortable environment for her is the key to getting her to drift off to sleep. Toss in an Autism driven sleep disorder and she has had a struggle. Not having to many options to work with I turned to absolute comfort. That's where Memory Foam Solutions came to the rescue. At the very least despite the setbacks my daughter deserves a wonderful nights sleep. Memory Foam Solutions gives my daughter the extra support she needs to help her not only fall asleep but stay asleep. She wakes up rested and not in the middle of the night either. Sleeping all through the night seems to be the normal at our home and I love it. The foam is outstanding when pressure is applied to it the foam forms around. Then it bounces back like nothing was ever there. It hugs your body and alleviates the discomfort from a long day. - See more at: http://www.frugalmomandwife.com/2015/01/twin-3-elastic-memory-foam-mattress-pad.html We are very happy with the Memory Foam Solutions mattress pad. It gives you the added support you need without breaking your budget!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Update Nov. 10.2015: This thing sucks, totally inaccurate. I started measuring against known weights (thanks metric system) and it is wildly unreliable. Adding small measures of water to a container does not show up consistently, so you will see a jump every 50-100 grams while slowly adding something. Downgraded from 2 stars to 1 star.

I like the style and apparent built quality, the glass top makes it very easy the clean in the kitchen.

Unfortunately, it is wildly inaccurate at the gram-scale, and unreliable at ounce-scale, and only useful for lbs/kgs. I am past the return period and will be chucking it to buy another brand."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I cannot say enough about this set.  It is a great product for the price.  It is so easy to use.  I have used the Tumbler for several weeks now and it is still going strong.  I will be buying another one for my daughter.  I love it.  I love the color and the size.  It is a great quality.  I just wish there was a way to go by the size.  It is very easy to clean
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I've been using the Frigidaire Professional Programmable Water Kettle several times a day and I have not once been disappointed! This kettle has several improvements over my previous electric kettle. First, the water tank holds 1. 7 liters so I do not need to continually fill the kettle. When I fill the kettle with filtered water in the morning, it lasts all day and into the evening without refilling. My previous kettle would only make three cups of tea before refilling and this kettle makes 7 cups of tea. Second, the water temperature is controlled with a digital display. The temperature is measured in Fahrenheit on the top of the kettle. The settings include 175F (green tea), 185F (white tea), 195F (oolong tea), 200F (french press coffee), 212F (black tea). When I played with different settings and the same tea flavor, I would get different results. Temperature matters! The kettle automatically remembers the last setting and all I need to do is push start/stop to create a new pot of water. Finally, the kettle has a ""wow"" factor with multi-color lights! As the water heats up, the handle changes color from green to blue to purple to red to orange, indicating the temperature of the water. My kids and husband thought it was ""cool"" to watch the light show. I did observe condensation in the handle once the kettle cools down. This kettle is a huge improvement over my previous kettle (utiliTEA Variable Temperature Electric Kettle). My previous model had a temperature control knob that you turn right or left. and I never really knew how to get the temperature correct! Now when someone in my family adjusts the temperature of the water on this kettle, I will see the numeric temperature before pouring water over my tea leaves. If you like tea then you'll like this kettle! I'm very fussy over my tea as well as my kettle. UPDATE 2016: Three years later and it still works great! Everyone in my family uses this kettle and it's been reliable and efficient."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a great product - the timer ability sets it apart from average. Unfortunately, we purchased cool white, not realizing we needed warm white to match what we already have.  Still, this is a nice little light set and we'll find a way to use it in another setting."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"I do find it a bit too soft, but overall it's ok."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,I bought these for my 18 month old and they are ok.  I much prefer the infant ones as they are a little easier for her to hold and the support stick inside the popsicle is a little long on these and she gags on it.  It would probably be good for older kids or adults.  I also don't love the tray.  The popsicles have to sit on the tray in the freezer which is a bit precarious.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,CG,"I bought two for the garage. The first one worked perfectly. The second one I needed to install. The instructions were easy to follow. The first one was a little hard to read but it was well worth the price. I am very pleased with the quality of the product. The first one was a little tough to install and I had to use the tape to hold the hinges in place. I would recommend to anyone that needs a strong secure hinge.I bought this to replace a cheap Kohler DeWalt 1/4"" E-Zinc saw.  It is a very good saw, but the saw is a bit smaller than the DeWalt one.  I'll be ordering another one and will update my review if I need to.  It's a bit flimsy, but it's sturdy enough to hold my saw in place.  I wish it had a larger blade.  I'm hoping this saw will last a long time, but I'm going to try and purchase another one.I have used this"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,Bright light with a flip switch. The only problem is that it's not really a bright light.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,Great knife. I've been throwin' it at a lot of fights and my thumb is a bit broken.  I had to replace a broken thumb by myself.  I'm very pleased with it
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"Very solid built and appears to be well made.Very good quality.Nice, sturdy, and functional."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I bought two of these. They installed in a flash and look pretty much like the promo shots -- as though the books were floating in midair. The bottom book in the stack needs to be a good-sized hardcover (but not too big or else it sags). You can put anything you like on top of that. Once there, the books are not as conveniently accessed as on a normal bookshelf (and the bottom book is pretty much off-limits entirely).

As long as you are aware of these limitations before you buy, I think you'll be pleased."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Looks great but the glass doesn't stick as well. I will keep my glass in the store. I bought this for a friend, she loves it!I bought this for my daughter's room."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"The seat is easy to install and aesthetically pleasing. Toddler seat is stable. The reason why I gave it 3 stars is because the seat is very flat. There is no rise or ""horn"" in the front. When you have a newly potty trained toddler, they don't always understand leaning forward or making sure their privates are right over the hole, especially when they are trying to balance on top of a tall toilet. This problem applies to both a boy (especially) and a girl. If you have a squirmy toddler, the chances of peeing onto the top of the toilet seat is pretty high. My recommendation to the company is to add a contoured toddler seat. This seat is probably best used with an older toddler who understands the concept of being over the hole with no guidance from a contoured seat. We're returning ours."

It's been one of my favorite saws for the past few years and I'm sure I'll be buying more of these blades in the future.  I think it's going to be a great choice for the money.  I have a few of these in the house and they are a little heavier than I expected.  This saw has a nice feel to it and I like that it's not too heavy for me to carry around.  The blade will hold up very well.  I just wish that it was more lightweight.  I have used it a couple of times and it holds up well.  I like that it has a small ""pocket clip"" to hold the blade and I like that it comes with a belt loop.  I have used it"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,Bought used but works fine with some signs of wear. By good wire and welding is much better. Runs much hotter than expected for 110V weld machine.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,"This ratcheting handle only works on an AC system, which is a lot of work for a one-handed ratchet. The ratchet needs to be the same length as the AC switch so it doesn't accidentally lock in place. I was thinking about buying one of these. I knew I was going to have to order it, but I have a lot of money to spend. I just went with the Amazon Prime shipping and the two day return policy. I love Amazon Prime!  I would highly recommend this product. Perfect for my kids and it works great!I'm a huge fan of LED lighting, and this is my second one. I bought it to replace a ceiling fan that was installed to replace the old one."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Trust me when I tell you it's a very comfortable chair. I have a large one and a small one. I am a firm believer that if you don't get it right it's a little difficult to get it to do what it is supposed to do. The machine works well.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Have no idea what has happened to the quality of these containers. These have a strong tendency to get stuck in the dishwasher, and they're not very attractive to take out of the dishwasher. It's a shame, as it's not very sturdy. The packaging is a bit too small for what I wanted them for, but the containers are a solid quality. I just wish there was a way to label them. I don't know if this will help with the storage of my other jars, but I really like these containers. They're a very good value, and I'm very happy with the purchase. They do not come in a box, but I do think they're worth the price. I would recommend these containers for anyone looking for a good quality product. I have a small kitchen with a lot of space in it. I wanted a little bit more space to store things in and this fit the bill. I love the size of the small drawers and the fact that it is smaller than the standard storage drawer."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Used the item once. The lid was unbelievably tight, it wouldn't budge. Finally, I pried it off and gave it a go. Completely underwhelming. I used mini ice cubes and the motor was still strained to the point of smoking. Also, there is no way this should be marketed as a travel cup, the blender attachment is in the bottom of the cup and the cup itself is massive."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I purchased this Griddle to replace a Teflon Grill Teflon that I had been using for a year.  The grill is solid and is easy to clean.  I used this grill to heat up the Keurig, and it worked great.  I used it for the first time to cook with a single scoop of nonstick chicken broth, and the nonstick chicken made a very flavorful, flavorful chicken broth.  The nonstick chicken broth was perfect, and I don't have to worry about the chicken being cooked too hot, since I don't need to worry about it being cooked too cold.  This grill is perfect for the heat I need to heat up the steak, as well as to cook the other meats.  I can also use it for the other meats, such as chicken, beef, pork, and chicken breast.  I like that the nonstick chicken broth is thicker and easier to clean, as well as that the nonstick chicken is easier to clean and clean with the other nonstick chicken.  I like that the nonstick chicken is easier to clean with the other nonstick chicken, and that the nonstick chicken is easier to clean with the other nonstick chicken.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,I purchased this light because it has the same light bulb but it comes with a different battery and the other two bulbs are dimmable. The light bulb is a little brighter and it's brighter. It's not a huge deal for me but if I had to choose between these two bulbs I'd probably go with the dimmer option. I'd say this light bulb is a very bright light bulb and it's pretty strong. I like that it's not too yellowish to look at but I'd be happy with it if it had a bright white light. It's not really a bright light bulb but it's probably worth it.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,As advertised. Used this to smooth out the rough edge on the cut side of porcelain tiles. Used while spraying water.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,Decent for the price. I am using it behind my love seat...so it works.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"I recently had a false alarm.  It was a two-way alarm, which was just what I wanted.  The house was designed to have a separate alarm when you were away from it.  It is in the middle of the night.  This is a two-way alarm.  It is very easy to set up, and you can turn it on and off at will.  It does not have a flashing light on it, but"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Switches work great. Integration is simple and the tools are included. All in all, a great buy. I had a similar Schlage switch but the Schlage version was very flimsy. The blades were not in good shape, they were loose. This is a very good switch. I bought this as a gift to my wife."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Love this pitcher. We have been making tasty infused water all summer with fresh fruit.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,Very tiny and works very well. Comes with a battery. Has an attachment to put it on a key ring..Very cute and useful.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I'm totally pleased with my purchase. The quality is just as advertised. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy. The only reason I gave it 4 stars"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Glad to see the Kershaw name still represents quality no matter where its made.  Great Knife fast action and great quality.  coating is great and the quality I expect from the Kershaw brand.  Locking bar is extension of frame which is nice touch since it doesn't add extra parts and weight to knife.  Its a average weight knife but pretty slim and comfortable in pocket.

For the price it offers a lot of features and works really well.  The light is easy to install, just need your basic power/neutral and ground wire. The electrical box I was installing it into was tiny, but it fit.  I did wrap the outlet terminal screws with 2 layers of electical tape for added protection.

The screw terminal are the stab and screw kind, they seem to bite into the wire and hold it well. The child protection is smooth, I have other outlets where you have to use some force to plug something in, this outlet does not have that problem.

The dimming feature is really awesome and simple to use, really couldn't ask for more.  There is a short delay for the night light to turn on, another reviewer said dark pants set it off, not sure how that is happening."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"An affordable, straight forward way to process wood.  It doesn't know when to quit!

There is a reason this Bow Saw is so highly rated, and that is because it is a quality product.

The Bahco Bow Saw is for series wood cutting.  Smaller branches will be problematic but large pieces of wood will get blown away like a snowman going into a blast furnace.

We highly recommend it!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,It's still in the box because I am saving it for a special time to give to my husband. He loves smiley faces so will probably give it to him for Valentines. I really like it so I know he will!
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"I like it. So far, it's working well. works great."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,We needed a new light for our hunter fan.  This one fits perfectly and gives the amount of light we need.  Love it.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Wow! Very easy to install and easier to program. I bought one to control my front porch lights and after two weeks I decided to buy a second for the rear door.  It comes preset to turn lights on at dusk and off at 11pm.  All you need to do is set the time and your coordinates (table is provided) and you're set! I don't have to come home to a dark house anymore. Quality of the switch seems top notch and it looks very nice installed. Very happy with purchase!

The only reason I gave it"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Assembling the unit takes about 5 minutes.  You will need one 7/16"" wrench (or ratchet or crescent wrench or 11 mm wrench) to tighten the nylock nuts that hold everything together.  As the bolts are all carriage bolts, no screwdriver or other wrenches are required.  Once assembled, the unit attaches to the ladder with a pair of locking pins.  At first glance the assembled products doesn't seem like it would fit as securely as I'd like.  However, I attached it to a 32' Louisville type IA ladder and it actually fits very securely.  Upon lifting the ladder to a height of about 22' and leaning it against the shingles on my roof, I found the product to be very secure and the ladder very stable.  My gutter-cleaning problems are now over.

Side note:  I agree with another reviewer that the sheet-metal edges are very sharp and could definitely use a little sanding."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This cover fit perfectly and is beautiful in my room.  It feels thick and good quality.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"This is an easy install, easy setup, and it works perfectly. We would love to see the app refined and cleaned up a bit though - and the ability to search or sort opener history in some way. Right now its just a long scroll of activities - if you wanted to see a door trigger from a week ago, you have to scroll through them all to that point.

App issues aside, this product works great."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Hard anodized cookware makes cooking enjoyable again!  The dutch oven evenly heats on my electric range, while living up to its non-stick performance promise.  You can slow cook a pot of chili in it all day and know its not going to burn or stick.  The slender handles are nice.  I've always hated thick, bulky handles that don't resist heat well.

So much, that I decided to buy some standard size for our guest room. Instead of buying the Standard size, I went for the 2 pack deal. To my surprise they are NOT THE SAME! They were packed, jammed packed, into a small postal service box. BURSTING at the seams!! After taking them out, I noticed they are super flat, and barely any down alternative filling in them.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,CG,"i've wanted to install under a sink, but the instructions are a little difficult to understand.  The instructions are not very clear.  There is also a instruction booklet on the back that does not explain how to use the light.  There is also a section on the back that does not explain how to use the light.  I have had to use a magnifying glass to adjust the light.  This light is not meant for children.  I have a small, portable, light that is very bright, but the light is too small to fit in my small bathroom.  There is a small, portable light that is very dim, but the light is not very bright.  I have had this light for a few weeks and it is still working.  I have had no problems with the light.  It is very bright, but I have never had any problems with it.  I would recommend this light to anyone who needs a light that works well.Great buy.  So much brighter than the other ones I have purchased.  No more having to buy these for the garage, kitchen, or bath.  The adjustable dimmer is a must.  I have tried several different dimmers in various sizes and colors.  I have also tried dimmers with different colors.  These work great.  I highly recommend them.  I bought 2 of these to replace the one in my son's bedroom.  Very happy with this purchase.My husband loves this and he loves it so much. He has never had to"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I absolutely love these sheets.  They are well worth the little extra price for this quality.  I have purchased 500 thread count sheets before that you can almost see through after a few washings.  These are soft and thick and luxurious.  They have quickly become my favorite sheet set.  I haven't found a negative yet and hopefully will not.  They are now out of stock but am waiting for more to come in so I can purchase a second set.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,This is my third one. I lost the other two. I carry it all the time. Very useful. I use the file as a light weight flat head screw driver in a pinch. The plastic tooth pick is a must for me.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I love this vent fan. The only sound I hear is the sound of moving air. I did replace an existing fan and I replaced it on the ceiling side.

In the plus side I called kid craft and they are shipping our replacement pieces. The furniture does seen solid."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"So have another model of this brand and its worked out great. I carry these ladders on my work truck everyday. We do A/C, Chimney sweeping, pellet stove/gas insert work, dryer vents so having a ladder that can be multifunctional just makes the jobs run smoother. recommend. they are a little heavier but gives you more versatility which is a good trade off."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Inexpensive and does the trick! Replaced a tone of grungy almond colored switches. Crisp & clean and we have light!
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I bought one of these units in 2008 when I saw one on the news.  I checked my area on the Internet and saw I lived in a red zone for radon.  When I received it and let it settle in for 2 days, the level was 6.0.  The EPA said 4. O is the highest safe level for radon.  I called to have a radon removal system installed.  Very quickly the level dropped to 1.9 and the company guaranteed their system would keep it that low.  Now for the problem.  It did stay a 1.9 for about 3 years but then a power outage came and the unit then, after being reset, read 2.0.  Later, another power outage came and the unit read 2.1.  Lastly, after another outage, it read 2.2.  Finally, a long outage came and the unit never recovered and all it would show was two dashes.  I think it got fried little by little.  But all in all, I'm ready to buy another one but I will plug it into a surge protector this time.  At one point in time during the higher readings, I did call the company and the person I spoke to did tell me that the unit did not--NOT-- need to be re-calibrated.  That is why I think it got fried from a power surge. So, you might want to invest in a good surge protector for this product if you have one or buy one.

Update:  The day after I wrote the above.  Husband reset the unit's memory and let it ""smell"" the air for over 48 hrs.  Now the reading is .08 and it seems to be working just fine.  I think maybe (what do I know?) the power surges did do something to it for it to keep jumping up like it did but now, with a reset memory, it is working great.  Keep the instructions that come with it in case you have to reset your unit someday."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,CG,Like it for hunting. Not an easy task to manage but it works for me.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"These splash blocks are a little lighter weight than I expected.  That being said, they are embossed like stone and a pleasing color so they are attractive as far as splash blocks go and satisfied the building inspector.  The price was right too."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,CG,"It works but I have had it for a long time.

The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the design. "
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Bought this for my Zojirushi (Coffee) and I'm very happy with the purchase. It is so easy to use and the attachments are very easy to use. The only thing that I do not like is that the lid is very small. This is why I ordered this for the price. It is a bit smaller than I thought but I think it is a good quality product. I just wish the lid was a little wider to hold more coffee. It's very easy to open and close the lid. You can see the coffee inside the lid and it's not just the coffee that's inside but the beans that are inside the lid. I can't say enough about how I like this product. I got a second one for my daughter to use when she's in her first year of college and she loves it. I have used it
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,I bought this to replace my 30 year old single speed Dremel.  WOW!  Shouldn't have waited so long.  All the attachments really make DIY home improvement so much easier.  So much fun to use that after I'd had it for a while I found myself looking for ways to use some of the attachments I hadn't yet needed.  The only thing that's not so great is it seems to be in a box meant for more than one model - so there are molded places to put things that aren't included.  That takes up space in the box that could be better used to store what DOES come inside & would make it easier to put stuff away.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"My wife and I are both very happy with the quality of this product.  She loves the extra size so we can use it for both our kids' and our preschoolers' bedding.I had this for a few months, and it was perfect.  I ordered two for the party.  They are both the perfect size, and I have a set for my husband's room.  It does not take up much space on my counter, and it's very easy to clean.  I would highly recommend this product.I really love these.  I put them in my refrigerator and it's a breeze to put them on my clothes.  I love how easy they are to put on and how well they don't slip off.  They look great and I like the quality.  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.Thank you.Works great. Easy to clean. I used this for a few days and I am very happy with the results.I have been using this product for about 4 months now and it is doing the job.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,CG,"Handle feels nice and overall looks good, the finish is good, and the blade is sharp and stable. The blades are plastic, but they're not plastic, so it's not like they are made of plastic. I would think it would be OK for some applications, but for other applications it's not. Overall, I'd give it 4 stars. These are great. I just installed them with the wire stripper and they work great. It's very easy to install and works great. I'm going to order another set of these for my other bathrooms. I'm a huge fan of LED lighting, and this is my second one. I bought it to replace a ceiling fan that was installed to replace the ""top of the house"" LED bulb. It is a great LED bulb, and the color is great."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is exactly what I needed for all of my shoes. The assembly of the unit was obvious and straight forward. No instructions were necessary though they were provided.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,You get what you pay for. The quality is good but it's also a little pricey.Great product. Great price. I am very happy with the purchase.This is a great fan. It is quiet and does not have a fan noise. This fan is very quiet and does not
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Such a great tool. Gets in tight spaces with ease. You do need to hold on to it to keeps it steady and apply pressure to it to help drive screws in since the weight of the drill is not directly behind the fastener with it attached. The head of the tool also has a nice magnetic ring that olds the heads of screws firmly in place.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Well I've had this installed for a few months. Ended up purchasing 6 more dimmers. The HomeKit interface is great. The overall quality has met my expectations for the current products on the market. My biggest tangible complaint is the wall switches have a cheap feel. The remotes feel more sturdy and less wobbly when you press the buttons. The app works well on the iPhone and watch. Siri is a bonus but Apple needs to work on their side of the integration a little more. Most of the time I can use Siri quickly for dimming or turning the lights on. The app needs some improvement with the geo location. I added my girlfriend to the app. However, I have the app programmed to turn the lights off when I leave. If my girlfriend is home it still turns them off. Not big deal but this would be a pain if you have a big family. You can easily turn this feature off if you don't like it. Lutron if you're listening please keep improving the app and hub integration with other products. Bonus points if you program an alarm clock dimmer. Overall, the best you can get for the price and quality level. 5 stars based on that fact. The reality is its more of a 4."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I have purchased several projection spoons and they work just fine.  These have a strong edge to them and have a nice weight to them.  The plastic is a great material and the color is beautiful.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Excellent device.  Checked it vs my multimeter and was almost dead on.  I used it to check my refrigerator kWh.  What an eye opener.  Next I'll be looking for a new refrigerator.  My refrigerator should be using about 715 kWh per year.  Mine is using about 1550kwh per year.  Guess it is getting near end of its life.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"This was a good idea unfortunately it is made with cheap metal, the shelves all bend in the center under the weight of the lightest pasta box. Forget about being able to store anything like cans or jars, not gonna happen. I would also like to add that DBRoth company has the worst business sense ever. The seller did not respond to my request to return till it was too late, then I was told they would grant me a partial refund so I sent the item back at my expense and it's been over three months later and I have not received a refund."

I looked at some previous reviews that said that the towels slipped through the gap with this item, but I haven't found that to be a problem at all.

Put the items in the bag, zip up the top very secure, suck the air out of the bag with a vaccum, put the cap back on very tightly. I then listened for any air coming out of the top and out of the cap and didn't hear anything. However, the air seems to always come out of the bags either overnight or after a few days.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"As the title states, it does its job decently (It could be better) but it is really flimsy. After applying pressure to it you have to trace it back with something otherwise you won't be able to notice the shape.

Would not recommend unless you don't find anything else."

I just wish it had a little more top-end support, but that is the only reason I gave it 5 stars.I had no idea that this was a bedsheet. I was worried it would be too short and a bit too heavy, but it's a great quality and it fits perfectly. I love it!This is a fantastic product.  I am very pleased with it.  I have been using it for a month now and the color is absolutely gorgeous.  I was skeptical about the quality of this product, but it is definitely worth the money.  I would highly recommend it.This is a great product.  I have to say it is not the most durable liner I've ever used.  I wish it had been a little larger,"

Unfortunately, it just would not work properly. Possibly a shorted wire inside."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I also purchased the LU79 which I used to crosscut thin veneered Chinese Birch and it was quiet, smooth, fast, and the cut was perfect, no tares or splinters; I could have used it all day. It takes me a little time to change blades but it is worth the time to make great cuts in this plywood. It is only 1/2 inch thick but tares easily and is thin on top and very smooth. This wood can look bad with the wrong blade so I am read glad I got this 80t thin kerf blade. This is the 3rd Freud blade I have now and they cost more but your projects will have a great finished look you can be proud of."

This one is very bright and it's a little smaller than the one I was using. This one is still very bright. I haven't used it with a dimmer, but I'll try it with a dimmer. I'll just have to get some wire strippers to go with it. It's very easy to program it to your liking. You can change the brightness from the dimmer to the full circle. There is a small fan in the bottom that doesn't work with the dimmer. It's not a bad deal for this light. I don't know if it's the dimmer's fault or if it was a bad design, but it's"

I'll update then."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I bought this an an everyday carry light to keep in my pocket. This flashlight fills that role nicely. 120 lumens is plenty of light for walking down a dark alley, or finding items in my car at night, it is even bright enough to use as a tactical flashlight for close range use. Full power mode will allow you to see quite well at 25 yards while medium power in excellent for situations where you don't need 120 lumens, such as walking the dog. Low power mode is excellent for tasks such as unlocking a door or reading. I could live without the strobe as I don't have much use for it.

The ergonomics of this light are well thought out. The checkering allows for a secure grip, but it isn't abrasive. Furthermore the tactical style bezel is rounded out enough to avoid abrasions and scrapes to the user while being aggressive enough to get the job done. Perhaps the best feature is the power switch, as it is well thought out. Press the button slightly for momentary on and press the button until it clicks for constant on. Once the light is in constant on mode, a half press of the button will switch to medium power, another half press for reading mode, and yet another held press for strobe. When the light is turned off, it will reset to full power the next time the light is turned on.

Perhaps my only complaint (a small one at that) is that the light makes a high pitched whine when on medium power mode. This is only noticeable when the light is near your ear.

Overall, I would recommend this light for everyday carry use because it is well thought out, built with quality, and above all else it is reliable."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Does what it's supposed to, I guess. It is a little too wide of an opening for our skinny fake tree, which looks a little odd-I can arrange it so it fits better though. If we ever decide to get a real (thicker) tree it'll work out better. It isn't the best tree skirt but it isn't the worst. The characters are cute. The material is a heavier felt. I don't buy anything expensive because I have a 3 year old who is the destroyer of all nice things. This isn't going to be advertised on the cover of Martha Stewart living's tree skirt of the season, but if you just need something cheap quick this should work fine."

The only thing I wish it were a little more compact is the size. I still have a lot of ice cream to clean with it and it's a great size too. I think it would be perfect for my kid's birthday party or even if he wears a little bit of a sweater for the kids.I bought this for a friend who has arthritis in her hand and she loves it!

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"I have kinda a love/hate relationship with these flashlights. I love that they are super affordable and you get three flashlights. They are plastic, not aluminum, but the tolerances seem tight and they appear relatively water resistant. I left the floodlight on last night and after 4-1/2 hours the light intensity was down to about 25%, but still usable.

The non-focusing flashlight produces a tight, bright beam that easily illuminates objects 50-75 feet away. The light bar floodlight works great for close up work or will light half a room bright enough to read. The rubberized flat black exterior is nice and ""grippy."" The magnet is sufficient to hold the light vertically or horizontally on smooth sheet metal.

Ugly? Oh, man I so wish they provided directions on how to open these suckers up to insert the batteries! (3 AAA--not included) TIP: half the textured base near the magnet (opposite the on/off switch) slides open. There is a faint black arrow at the opening.

The bad? These lights have three settings--flashlight, floodlight and flashing red LED lights. Two of my flashlights worked perfectly, but the flashing red LED's never worked on the third. No biggie and I'm keeping them all, but it bodes ill for the reliability.

Still, these things are so cheap I can't complain--much.
___________________________________

UPDATE--that third flashlight with the non-operational red LED's? It drained the batteries flat while turned off! Obviously a bad circuit. I threw it away. A 33% failure rate is nothing to brag about."

It's easier to get products in and out of the Chico bags, and they hold a surprising amount of groceries an other items. Their compact design makes them easy to stash and have them around when you need them, in your pockets or vehicles. Easy to wash them, too. No more cheap ones for me. Also like the color variety."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"Update: 4/16/18 - It's been a couple weeks now and it's still working!  I'm just starting to get used to it.  I also bought the Tumbler, which is nice, but it's not really a value for the money.  This is still a good investment.  I'm not sure how I could get better than this!  I think the quality of this is just great.  I highly recommend it!I am returning this product. I have been using it for a month now and the only difference is that the handle is now a bit harder to use and the handle is a little more flexible.

I would not recommend this product.This is a great product.  I have to say it is not the most durable liner I've ever used.  It's a little hard to pull off the metal rod because the plastic tip keeps getting stuck on the rod.  I have had it for a month and it still works well.  It's not very durable and the fabric is not thick enough to hold the rod securely.  The inside of the rod is very tight.  The rod is now a little too long and the plastic tip is now more likely to get stuck on the rod.  I have also had it for a month and it still works well.  I had to return it because of that.

It's still a nice liner and a good value.Very nice."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,It's very comfortable. I'm always hot so I do have to turn it once in awhile during the night. It's just me....when I do move it just a little it's nice and cool.

It's a bit smaller than I expected it to be, but it's still a solid enough light. I just wish it came with a charger, which would have been nice.

Overall, this light is a great value. I would recommend this light to anyone who uses a lot of lights.Good quality, but not bright enough.  The soft white light appears to be a bit on the cheap side, but it does make up for it.  I would not recommend it for someone who has a lot of light, but it does look nice.

The scraper on the other side of the brush is great for a first pass at my frozen windshield and has maintained its edge after many uses.  Still, I'll use a hand scraper, not the scraper at the other end of the handle, to make a final pass at my windshield.

The brush has some weaknesses which you can easily work around.  After using your brush, fully extend it and give it a quick wipe to remove any water or snow.  If you don't, water will be trapped inside the unit and rust the shafts.  Also, the head may unscrew slightly when you push snow with the left corner of the broom.  But that will also cause the extension to unlatch, so only use the full brush and you'll be fine.

To clear up some confusion, it seems some items are shipped with a rubber squeegee.  This appears to slide over the scraper which is on the other side of the broom, hopefully able to be simply removed.  The brush I bought locally did not have this, but I sort of wish that it did.

Overall, this is a great brush for New England winters.  I'll be buying more for friends and family."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"I cut the strand into 2 pieces and the finish was good.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the design.  The ring is not solid, it's a bit bent and it's not clear how it will bend.  This is a problem for most people and a problem for others.  I also don't have the capacity to cut the rings into 2 pieces.  This is not a problem for me.  I like that the end of the ring is straight and that it's not hard.  I like that it has a ""stiff"" edge.  I like that the end is flat,"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"Nice packaging, and great communication from the seller. However, I wasn't pleased with the product itself. I ordered 9 of these bulbs and installed them in 3 ceiling fans in 3 different rooms. So this is not a review about a fluke bulb. First off, they have a delay when turning on. It's subtle, but it's there. I confirmed this by mixing other LED bulbs in a ceiling fan with one of these. These turn on a split second behind the other ones that are immediate on. Second, the color is very blue. I have many 5000k LED bulbs throughout my house. Base styles include: BR30, A19, E12 and G9. All of the other 5000k bulbs simulate (to me) natural daylight. These, however, have a much bluer tone to them. I've recently read that the blue in LED lights make people not be able to fall asleep. So, probably not the best for a bedroom. Aside from that, though, it wasn't a desirable color. Third, while I don't see a flicker while staring at the light, the room itself had a subtle disburance when these were on. With it dark outside, and only these lights being on, the room had a flutter to it. Sort of gave me a headache. Fourth, and last, these aren't very bright. All of my other 60w (equivalent) LED bulbs almost seem too bright at times. These, on the other hand, weren't bright enough. Three 60w bulbs in the ceiling fan of a 9x11 bedroom should be ample (It is with the incandescent bulbs), but with these it wasn't bright enough to read."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These along with a wide-mouth jar coffee filter have stepped my coldbrew game to a new level.  We prefer lattes generally, so I'll brew a bottle and split the coffee between two mason jars, then add milk & sweetener to taste.  Pour top goes on then in the fridge, ready & waiting to caffeinate our bleary brains long before things like brewing or pouring milk make any sense to a sleep-addled, decaffeinated mind.

Seal on these is decent, though I still keep my finger over the flip top when shaking.  Only complaint is that the flip top likes to flip closed while pouring if you don't hold it open."

I have also purchased the 3-way adapter and it is a great deal. I have had no problems with the flashlights and am very happy with the purchase. I am very pleased with this purchase. I hope the light has a longevity of a year.

I have a number of other flashlights and this one fits my needs perfectly. I have not had a problem with any of them. I would recommend this flashlight to anyone.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I am a recent convert to ball whisks and I purchased one of these smaller ball whisks for doing smaller jobs in the kitchen when I don't need a bigger whisk. It has lived up to my expectations and sees very frequent use.

There are several different sizes of whisks and this is the smaller of the ball whisks. This is the wrong whisk when doing larger jobs such as mixing a batch of brownies but it's perfect for beating eggs, mixing drinks and similar small tasks. Because of the shape it is well-suited for getting down into the edges of a bowl or sauce pan, something that traditional wire balloon whisks cannot do.

This is a very stiff and sturdy utensil and it holds up well under heavy use. Even with smaller wire whisks I have struggled with the handles breaking off, mainly because of water getting into the spring-shaped handles and rusting the wires until they fatigue. The handle on this whisk is of a better design that keeps water out so that there's no rust problem. Also, the tines are made of stiff steel wire, much more sturdy than that of wire balloon whisks, so it holds up well under stress.

This is a great whisk for smaller jobs in the kitchen. It is well-made and well designed, and it should serve admirably for many years."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This shower head is fantastic.  My other shower head was very noisy, and the water flow / coverage was not that great.  The main problem was that you had to reach / feel into the shower to see if the water was warm enough to get into the shower plus it took 1 minute minimum to warm up to a comfortable temperature.  This new head allows us to visually see when the water is cold, warm, and hot, it allows us to set a temp that we like visually (color of blue, green, red depict 3 temp ranges), has versatile spray selections although we basically use just the rain shower setting.  Also, a giant plus is how fast the shower warms up to temperature now - I'm guessing this benefit is because of better water flow allows the hot water to reach the head faster.  Anyway, this is a perfect addition, is not a gimmick, and the product is attractive and appears to be well built.  We have had it for 4 days, but so far so good!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This chandelier is simply beautiful.  At first I was wondering if the LED light bulbs would reflect nicely from the crystal.  The white light actually reflects and refracts much nicer. I hired an electrician to install this chandelier and another bigger one I bought on Amazon.  The strings with the crystals look difficult to put together but actually not.  If you are a handy man type, once you install the base flushed to the ceiling, it's just a matter of following the labels for the strings and hang them accordingly. My husband and I helped hang the strings.
Even my electrician said, ""wow it's beautiful:"". Definitely worth the money.
A word about the seller 7pm Lighting - given I could't find the electrician who had done work for us - I kept the boxes beyond 30 days before I found and scheduled an electrician. The Seller assured me that the help would not run out should anything was missing and that I needed help.  Turned out the packaging was perfect and there were a couple pieces of spare parts.
Highly recommend both product and Seller 7pm Lighting!  I have attached a few pictures."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I was looking for a white plastic mailbox post that would fit a large mailbox (Solar Group E1600), that wasn't over $100. I liked the idea of the vortex anchor for this, but the reviews of that were horrible, so I used a standard pressure treated 4x4. The post slides right over it and then you use lag screws to secure it. Oddly you screw it at the edge/corners and not the center of the sides. It made it slightly more challenging, but not impossible. The base also fits snuggly, but is not secured, so you can raise it up to trim grass. The best feature is that the mailbox support is not part of the post, so when you install it you can put it at the exact height you want, so you don't have to plan EXACTLY where the base will be to get the mailbox height correct, you can adjust afterwards.

An installation note, if using a 4x4. You don't have to make the wood post as tall as the mailbox post, the instructions tell you only to make it a foot or so above ground. While I bought an 8' post, and made mine almost as tall as the mailbox post. I could have bought a 4' post instead and would've been fine. (I actually looked for a 6' one, but all Big Orange had less than 8' was the 4'.) That might make it easier to install, and bring the post home. I also thought it was worth renting a post hole digger, I wanted it deep, I knew the roadbed was close (no curb here), and I wanted to save time."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"Very disappointed for three reasons. 1) A small atomic weapon is required to open the packaging.  2) The hose is very stiff.  That makes the hand-held part difficult to maneuver and also transmits motion to the  head bracket.  And 3) the hose connectors are absolutely smooth and thus impossible to tighten by hand.  And the use of any tool will mar the finish.  At least one other model apparently has ""ridged connectors"" because the directions which came with mine refers to them.

I wonder if it was not Water Pik's intention to punish me for buying an inexpensive model?

From what I saw in the store (mine was not purchased from Amazon) the packaging is such that you cannot see the hose and connector type until you have purchased the thing and somehow have managed to open it."

The new version of the product has a plastic sleeve that gives a more accurate temperature reading but why care when it takes all day to chill the bottle of white?

If you put your white wine in the refrigerator to bring it close to serving temp and then put it in the chiller it might work to your advantage (the unit won't be on very long) but this thing is not worth whatever you're going to pay for it.

Spray the back plate and prongs with cooking spray, line the drip tray with foil, tie the legs and wings to hold together tightly, put it on the rack with the legs facing away from the motor. In 80 minutes it was done without any problems. It was the juiciest chicken we've ever had, very tasty indeed. You cannot get this from your oven, no way. The complaint of some about the heat this puts out wasn't a problem. I have a ceramic cooktop and it was just fine on it. I can't wait to try turkey breast or a very small turkey.
I took one star away for the following: the rotators sometimes have a skip or delay because one wheel sits on the other without any additional latch to keep them together. For chicken roasting this is less of a problem, but I can see lighter foods or unbalanced loads have an issue. There is no on or off button, instead you have to unplug to turn it off and there is no pause button to stop the rotisserie to check for doneness, you have to unplug to stop it. Was it worth $10? Heck yes, would I pay the regular price? Probably not."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"My wife is very particular about ""her things"", and when her tea kettle was starting to rust out, she hinted that she would like a new one for her birthday.  So I found this highly reviewed kettle on Amazon and thought it a good deal for many years of service.  When my wife received it for her birthday, she was not completely satisfied, but over the past two months she has ""gotten used to it"".  Here are her complaints:

1. Difficulty getting water into it.
  - with my wife's old kettle, she filled it through the spout.  The spout on this kettle is a bit narrower than her old one, so at first water would spill down the side and get the outside wet.  She also tried to use the filling lid on top, but the lid has tight tolerances (so steam doesn't escape or rattle around), and the handle doesn't move, so there is no clear path to the pot without getting the outside wet.

2. Difficulty eating water out of it.
  - as you can see from the picture, the spout protrudes from the upper quarter of the pot.  This means she has to hold the kettle at an almost 90 degree angle to pour her hot water, and dousing her hand with a good bit of hot steam.  With filling the kettle a bit fuller than she is used to, we are able to get around that problem.

Now that she's had two months of kettle ownership, she is much better at aiming water into the kettle, and doesn't have so many problems.  She has also noticed that with the flatter and wider bottom of the new kettle, it does heat faster, and it is easier to clean with the nice enameled finish.  However, I think next time that we need a new kettle, I'm just going to install a hot water dispenser at the sink."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"There's a lot to like about the A-Flow 5 Function Dual shower head, primarily the fact that it provides a number of different combinations and settings with solid flow (even with flow restrictors). Installation is fairly easy, directions are so so, but they include plumbers tape in the box as well as spare parts (a HUGE bonus).

It took me about 10 mins to install and get set up, once i did, I found the flow to be very solid (even with a flow restrictor on). The instructions tell you how to remove the flow restrictor, but we chose not to.

Switching between the main shower head and the extension head is pretty easy and the settings on the extension heads are as good as the main head. Of the settings, the massage mode stands out the most as it kicks out a lot of water at a high speed, pulsing quite rapidly.

The only downside of this shower head is the main connector piece that switches between the two heads is plastic and on the one I got, dripped very slightly at the switch. It's a small gripe, for an otherwise good showered.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I have used this for fine cracks in my drive way for about 5 years.  Some cracks take multiple fillings to finally fill the crack.  It sticks to the concrete and holds it together keeping it from spreading out.  One of the really important functions is to seal the crack so that water can not get down to undermine the concrete or to fill the crack in the winter, freeze and spread the concrete apart.  It totally seals the crack.  Some cracks I have gone back the next year and applied a little more of the sealer to update the sealing of the crack.  It works wonderfully like nothing I have ever seen before and I have owned homes for 49 years."

I use a handheld stone to clean up the blade a bit before using this sharpener. But, for the price and convenience it's a reasonable tool sharpener."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"I recently purchased this after picking way too many apples.  Knowing I had a lot of peeling ahead, I thought this would be a wonderful solution.
It turned out to be a complete waste of money & time.
The plastic is flimsy, the handle pops off while you are turning it, and the suction cups on the base are weak.
One of their selling points is ""the spring loaded blade peels the apple skin in one continuous motion"", but when the handle keeps popping off that means a lot of stopping & restarting.
They likely did this 'assemble at home' so it would fit into a smaller box.  Would have been well worth it to have a larger box & the handle attached to the peeler so you really could peel in one continuous motion.
The peeler does work...just not very well.  In my opinion, there are others listed here on Amazon that are better constructed and would do a much better job for just a few dollars more.  I did not realize something this simple would require researching before buying but now I know!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I needed a frame to put my king size matress on to get it up off the floor. I didn't have a box spring so I needed something with support. I was on a budget so after much shopping I decided this was the frame for me. I worried somewhat about putting it together as my husband, although multi talented has little patients for cheap products. Come Mother's Day we set to putting it together. My oldest daughter stepped up to help. What a surprise. They had it put together in less than an hour with no fuss or cuss. lol My husband has a helpful hint, when putting the wooden slats in don't tighten the middle support beam completely. This allows the slats to snap in with no effort. Just remember to tighten the middle support after attaching all the wooden slats. Also use your own wrench, the supplied one is of no use. The proper size is a metric #12 wrench. Ok, bed is up, now comes the true test. I am a big woman, weighting around 275 on a good day. Well, the bed didn't even creak when I laid down on it. I am also a restless sleeper so I toss and turn alot, bed is doing great. Several weeks after using my new bed, my neice and her boy friend came for an overnight visit. Now I don't know thier exact weights but I can say that the combined total was over the 600lbs. limit for the bed. I was worried but I love my neice and would never hurt her feelings for any reason. Not a problem, they spent 2 nights on it, and not one broken slat.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"REVIEW OF:  TCP RLP381430WL 14W LED PAR38 40 DEGREE WET LOCATION RATED SPOT LIGHT BULB, WARM WHITE

This efficient bulb casts a nice bright light-Brightens the entire front of the house for added safety. This Light bulb's standard-sized base screwed in immediately to existing socket.

This indoor/outdoor LED light bulb exceeded expecations. Over the years energy saving bulbs have gotten better, but many still seem kind of dull and gloomy. Oftentimes, the bluish light just hurts your eyes.  How often have you consoled yourself with the thought that by compromising a nice light you are saving energy and money?  No longer.

This bulb is doing a great job of providing the outdoor porch with a nice warm, yet bright light. No creepy shadows where miscreants can hide!

A heavy bulb, it measures 5.2"" x 5.8"" x 5.9"".  It is rated to use 14 watts of energy, and at 1050 lumens it is theoretically equivalent to a incandescent 90 watt  bulb. This light bulb is fixed at that wattage and does not dim. One can expect this bulb to last about 25,000
hours.  Roughly that's about 5.7 years, assuming 12 hours of darkness a night (25,000/12/365=5.7 years.). Well, that'd be great and at $19.80 /bulb would give you outdoor weatherproof light for less than $3.50 a year.

The bulb should work well in most areas as it is rated to function at  temperatures ranging from  -4 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

Security is increased with brightly lit areas....................

I'd like to thank Amazon for the opportunity to review this indoor/outdoor LED light bulb that I received as a complimentary sample in exchange for this honest review.

I hope my review is helpful for you! Thanks for your time."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"We were having trouble cooking anything on our new cooktop. I am still not thrilled with the fridgidaire Professional cooktop (see different review) but we ordered new pans to see if that would help. These Ceramica pans are awesome. heating is very quick and the heat is even. no need to heat higher than med on the gas burners. We get great browning, no burning and the non-stick capability is superb.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"We just bought this coffee maker to replace our 15 year old Krups model.  The Krups still works fine, but it was white and various areas were starting to show brown coffee staining. The only feature change we have noticed in 15 years is that now the water comes out in a shower head spread instead of a single drip line.  This model also has a charcoal water filter packet and comes with a permanent gold-tone coffee filter.

We like the looks of this coffee maker and we notice it does not show fingerprints on the plastic coated stainless steel finish.  Some people have commented that their coffee pots drip when they pour and that some lids are hard or impossible to remove for cleaning the lid or the pot.  The pot on this coffee maker does not drip and the lid is easy to remove completely for cleaning.

Finally, we note this coffee maker has a three year manufacturer's warranty.  Hopefully, if ours lasts three years it will also last for fifteen years like our previous Krups.

Update 10/18/13:

After one year of use the lid of our DCC-2650 began to deteriorate.  Apparently the heat and steam from normal brewing caused the clear plastic coating on the lid to begin cracking and crazing.  I have posted two images of the crazed areas. The coffee maker still works perfectly, but the lid is not very attractive on our countertop."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I needed a new headlamp to replace one from a big box store which broke easily.  I chose this one because it has a separate switch for the red light.  I am an amateur astronomer, and I use a red light when I am observing to protect my night vision when reading star maps and eyepiece focal lengths.  It takes about 30 mins for your eyes to become dark-adapted, and thus able to see very faint deep sky objects.  A flash of white light ruins night vision for another 20-30 mins, and my previous headlamp had to cycle through 3 white light settings just to get to red, and this was a nuisance to me and anyone who was observing with me.  THIS headlamp allows me to switch on the red light without any possibility of turning on the white light, and I liked it so much that I purchased a second one for my wife.
Enough about red light, now I'll tell you what I like about the white light.  I had to do some work in the attic, and I used this headlamp to see what I was doing in the dark attic.  It starts of with the brightest white light setting at first one when you press the white light switch.  If you quickly press the switch again it goes to a dimmer setting for longer battery life if you're going to have it on for an extended period.  There are 3 brightness levels which can be accessed by pressing the switch again within about 5 seconds.  I am very pleased to tell you that you don't have to cycle through all these brightness levels to turn it off, because after being on in any brightness mode for more than 5 seconds results in it simply switching off with ONE press of the switch.  All this and a LIFETIME WARRANTY for an incredibly low price.  Stop looking now and buy this one -- you won't be disappointed."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I have purchased six different brands, and models of 24 cup mini muffin pans.  I can't begin to tell you how many differences there are from pan to pan.

The reason I prefer this pan over others is that I bake mini brownies, cupcakes, carrot cakes and 'mini bite"" pastries of all kinds.  I use the fluted paper baking cups that measure 1-1/2"" X 1""
deep.  I use Reynolds brand, FC150x350 paper baking cups. the box says 3-1/2"" fluted cups, but that's the measurement before the cups are formed at the factory. *** Since the cups of this pan are only 3/4"" deep it allows the cakes and brownies to slightly ""flair out"" at the top; making them look larger than the ones made in deeper pans with the same 2"" diameter at the top.

I baked the identical pastries (half made in this pan, and others that were baked in the pans that were !"" deep). I offered them on trays set side by side, telling customers that they were ""IDENTICAL IN WEIGHT AND VOLUME"". Not one customer chose the pastries that were baked in the deeper pans. When you look at the finished product; made in this pan, it ""LOOKS"" and IS larger at the top!

I LOVE this pan, above any of the others and ""HIGHLY RECOMMEND"" it! The non-stick surface is outstanding too.

The Commercial II non-stick 24 cup mini- muffin pan measures 15-3/4"" by II""; each muffin measures 2"" in diameter and 3/4"" deep.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"I bought this to mount Board Buddies on my Dewalt-744 table saw.  The saw has a 19.5"" fence, so I had to cut the aluminum slide on both ends with a hack saw so that the wood screw holes would be centered over an auxiliary wooden fence a.k.a feather board that I made.  The saw's aluminum fence is 1"" wide with screws on its back side away from the blade.  I had to replace the Dewalt screws with equivalent 2"" sheet metal screws to attach the featherboards.  I made the wooden fence out of two pieces of 3/4"" hickory so that it would be hammer-handle tough.  I needed two pieces to make the fence wide enough to take wood screws from the slider as it is 2 1/4"" wide.  The holes for the wood screws in the slider are set 1 3/4"" from the edge.  Ideally, one would make the featherboard out of one piece that is 1 1/4"" thick, but good luck trying to find some.

All went well until I had to screw the aliminum slide onto the auxilary wooden fence.  I drilled deep pilot holes.  But, two of the brass-colored wood screws provided with the slide snapped off when the screws got deep into the wood.  The first time it happened, I was able to recover by separating the two hickory boards and unscrew the stub because the screws fell exactly between the featherboards.  Then I decided to glue the boards together so that the screws would be more secure.  On my second attempt to mount the slider, a second wood screw snapped.  This one was much more difficult to extract.  I had to use a hand grinder to dig a pit around the stub so that I could get a lock wrench on it.

MY ADVICE:  use the stainless steel wood screws that are supplied with the Board Buddies instead of the cheap brass-colored screws that come with the slider."

I also like the fact that the containers are made of plastic.  I use them to make a coffee cup for my boyfriend who has a very small space and a very big bathroom.  I also like the fact that they are made of glass.  I just put them in the freezer for a few minutes and they are a perfect size for me.

Its very powerful, and I have other Dewalt tools that use the same battery so it kept going and going.  A setting of 3 or 4 (out of 10) was plenty to counter sink the nail (2 1/2 inch) into the wood molding.  I have finished 2 rooms with no jams or misfires.  If you are used to an air nailer it might be a bit heavier but they compensate for the weight by balancing the load nicely."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"At first I thought I was getting a great deal, buying this dual switch for half the price of a Leviton one. But when I received it and checked out the rocker movement, I quickly concluded I got ripped off. The movement of the two switches is so flimsy and floppy, I can't image this thing will last anywhere close to my dead Leviton, which we had for nearly ten years before one of the rockers got jammed. While the rockers on this Baomain switch have some play in the ON direction and eventually require some effort to turn the switches on, in the OFF direction it takes very little effort to turn it off. When ON, only a slight tap causes the switch to turn OFF. I didn't bother wasting my time installing it, and instead went to my local hardware store and got a Leviton switch. Bummer, because I was very excited to save half off of my future switch purchases. Oh well; buyer be warned."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"I wanted to replace my living room lamps and these seemed perfect.  I ordered 2, but they didn't put out quite enough light to replace regular lamps.  They were super cool and I immediately got great comments on them.  I bought a third lamp immediately to brighten the room... and because I liked them so much.  All arrived in perfect condition and after a few months, I've still had no quality issues.  They perform as advertised.

They come with 2 serious down sides.  First, they take PLANNING if you plan to use them to effect.  They take about 7 hours to heat up enough to start flowing.  While heating, the lava doesn't really move.  Instead, they look like weird alien fetuses in lab jars.  I entertain a lot and always need to remember to turn them on by noon if I'm having guests that night.  Second, they are major energy hogs.  At 200 watts each, I'm running 600 watts of power for about 15 hours a day when I use them.  This irks me because the rest of my home is super energy efficient and I use LED lights whenever possible.  You gotta pay to play!

Overall, everyone loves them, and I do to.  But, I think one would have been a good accent, where 3 are a bit overkill and don't really put out enough light for anything other than ambiance.  I'll most likely split them up soon, putting them in different rooms so I don't have to use all 3 at once.

The switch has a self-healing mechanism. The ""healing"" is not a great feature, but it's a great feature.

I was thinking about changing the battery to a lithium-ion battery, but I ended up going with a non-dimmable version of this switch.

The other switch I used was a lithium-ion version, which is still a great feature, but it's more expensive than the one I replaced.

I replaced the battery with a non-dimmable one.

I had to replace"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,I love the look of this.  It added the perfect pop to my daughter's room!
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,"Bought 1 of these for my wife and she loves them. She also loves the way the shower is so small. I am using it in the shower to cover a lot of water. I have been using it in the shower for about a year now and it has not changed. It is very easy to adjust and I can use it on my shower head if needed. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a nice shower head with a good flow and quality. I have used them on the shower head, along with other shower heads, and they are very easy to install and use. I do recommend these to anyone looking for a nice shower head with a good flow and quality. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a good shower head with a good flow and quality. I have used these for about a year now and I am very happy with them. I have been using this as a bench saw for a few years now. It is very well made. The only thing that I didn't like is the rubber part of the saw. It is strong and will be easy to bend if you need to use a regular saw. The saw is very sturdy and will last a long time. The only thing I don't like is the rubber part of the saw."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I'm a 75 year old and assembled this product myself. I sat down, placed all the pieces on the floor, in order and simply followed the directions. I used a hammer covered with a sock and it worked just like a rubber mallet. I didn't want to make holes in my bathroom wall, so this product works perfectly for me. It looks modern and matches with all the bronze accessories in my guest bathroom and have gotten compliments from guests already. Thanks Amazon. I always find what I need at Amazon. Packaging and delivery were great too."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"American Standard's Everclean toilet seat is a nicely designed product.  Installation is very easy, the hardest part being the removal of the old seat, and the only tools needed are a screwdriver and plyers. It is made of light weight plastic, not covered pressed wood, with fully enclosed hinges so it should last a long time.  This will make cleaning a lot easier especially the area between the seat and the tank.  Well worth getting to replace the old worn out seat or just to spruce up the bathroom."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"im a finish carpenter and this will be the finish carpenter's first choice for the job.Great product. Great price. I am using it for the instruction of the table saw. The saw is well made and will cut your projects as you wish. This is a great tool for the money.I love these lights!  I have had them for a few years now and they are awesome.  I have tried to keep them on my truck because of the size of the light, but they are too small for the light.  I am very happy with them!  I have a few of them in my home that are just a tad too big for the light.  I have had them for about a year now and I can say they are awesome.  I had a few of them last"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I'm so glad I finally sprang for a Fluke meter.  My old Radio Shack model was giving me very unreliable readings, and was very slow.  This thing is extremely fast and I have to assume accurate.  I use it for home electronics work -- measuring AC and DC current, voltage, continuity, and so forth.  The build quality is excellent.
There is a very similar model for automotive use, but it doesn't provide accurate measurements for very small voltage and current, so not appropriate for electronics work.
There are also two other models in this line: the 175 which is just less accurate as far as I can tell, and the 179 which also offers a temperature sensor.
It's a little hokey the way the stand snaps against the main unit - sort of an uncomfortable friction fit -- and even when extended there isn't really a point where it snaps or cleanly stops.  It feels cheap but there may be a good reason they did it this way, perhaps it stands up better to heavy use and is less likely to break.
I also think it would have been nice to have an ON/OFF button, rather than have to rotate the dial all the way around to the left every time you want to turn it off.  There is an auto-off feature so you can just not turn it off if you want, though you'll use your battery up faster.
The leads that are provided are not premium - which is unfortunate considering the price of the device.  The wires are just not as pliable as I'd like, in that they want to retain their folded-up shape.  So I have ordered a set of more expensive replacement leads.
Also they don't provide any sort of alligator clips or any other attachment for the leads - just the bare metal points.  So again, I had to order those separately.
I'm still giving this five stars because I really love it ;-)"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,Tommyco Gel knee pads are a real pain to put in the foot.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Great product! I highly recommend this set!I love these containers.  They work well and look great. 
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I actually purchased these because of the lid and the infrared open. This was to keep my dog out of the garbage. Looks great. Opening works great. Easy to use. (On another note, it took less than two days for my very smart dog to realize she only had to put her very long snout over the red light to open the can!)"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Have a bunch of these and they work great.  The more you have the better they work as the transmission in the house is stronger.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,Cut this down to provide a more professional look.  I will be purchasing more of these for my other two
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Great light weight little cutting board. Wish they made this one in the bigger size. Goes right in the dishwasher.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,CG,"I suppose the reflector is a little too wide, but I'm not sure that's a big deal.  The light is bright, but it is not very bright.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.  I would also recommend this product to anyone that has"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I received my set fast and it was well packaged.  The set comes in a pretty blue that brightens up your kitchen.  The handles are see through plastic with a nice hole for hanging.  The brush has a white handle and the silicone bristles are blue.  The brush head removes for easy cleaning and is very durable and works great at spreading the BBQ sauce.  I have used other silicone brushes before but they did not come apart and they would get built up discoloration or food particles where the head connected to the handle.  The brush head stays on very well during use also.  The spatulas are all well attached and no matter how hard I pulled them they did not loosen or pull off the handles.  I have had so many of the rubber or silicone spatulas pull off and its so aggravating.  They handles are large and sturdy and very easy to grasp and use.  They are easy to clean and I just throw my in my dishwasher. My favorite feature is unlike the rubber spatulas these don't stain or at least mine have not yet and I use them daily. My set came with a small spatula that measures 9 inches long and the spatula head is 2 3/4 long and 1 3/8 wide.  The medium spatula and spoon are 10 inches long and measure 3 1/4 long and around 2 1/2 inches wide. Perfect for your everyday cooking or baking needs. I received mine in exchange for a honest, unbiased review.  My opinions are my own and you can trust if I find fault in a product I will let you know."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,I love this scale its easy to use I need two! If I would have known that Bed Bath and Beyond also carried this brand I could have saved myself the shipping cost. There are several YouTube videos that will also help answer any questions you may have.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Perfect for additional storage and convenience. The only problem is that it's not really a vacuum, but"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,Good quality solder. It does what it is suppose to.works great.Nice little light.  Works as advertised.  The plastic parts are very sturdy
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,"This is the 3rd broom I have owned with the bulb. I also have the Clipper. The bulb is dimmable, but it is the lightest bulb I have used yet. I have not had to replace it yet. This bulb is still very bright. I have used it with a portable shower head, and it is great. It has great heat and is great for cleaning up debris. The only negative I have is that I have to press the bulb to get it to turn on. I know that is not a big deal, but it will be a hassle. I do recommend it. I have not had to replace it yet. I have been using this to control my lights for years. It has held up well and has held up to a lot of abuse. I have no complaints about this. I have had this on a weekly basis for about a year now and I have had no issues. I have a 5 year old and this is the only light I have used that I know of that does not have this feature. The only thing I wish it had was that the battery would have a charge on it when it was not needed. I would have preferred this feature to have a charge on it. The best feature I have seen is the ability to charge this light on a single charge. I am very happy with the purchase and would buy again. I love this. I have a great kitchen and a great bathroom. I am so glad I bought this. It is a very good value and I have used it for a few years now."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Didn't but it here but, it has the quality and design of a lot of other products.  It is so easy to use.  I also like the fact that the sides are adjustable so it doesn't look like a fixed size.  I wish it was a bit thicker but I would love it if it was a bit heavier.  I have a hard time getting the ball into the hole when I push it"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Very happy with this accessory, especially for the price. Very good quality."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,This knife comes super sharp and with a very nice boot sheath. My one complaint would be that the handle is very small if you have large or average hands you will most likely find it a little too slender.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Installed these on my outdoor lighting transformers. They do NOT have a memory of the setting if power is lost but this is a compact and well designed unit so it gets 5 stars.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"I'm missing 3 trays from this set, the first one was a gift for my sister and one for my mom.  The second trays are for the daughter who had a very large eye.  I'll be purchasing another set for her.This is a great value. The reviews are great. It is a good"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Finally, after buying many coffee makers, I thought it would be a nice addition to the kitchen.  It's not.  I am a firm believer that if you don't get it right, it won't work.  I am very pleased with the quality of the coffee maker.  I have used it with a variety of things including hot water and a coffee maker that has a traditional style style top.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get a very good quality coffee maker.

The other coffee maker I've used, which I haven't had a chance to try yet, is the K-cup Coffee Maker, which is not as big as the K-cup maker I have now.  The K-cup coffee maker is much more compact, it is much more accurate and easier to operate.  I have no complaints about this.  It is not the best quality coffee maker I have ever used, but it is good quality.  I bought a K-cup machine about a year ago and have been using it for several years.  The K-cup machine is very easy to operate, and I find that it"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,CG,"It works okay as a starter set, but the instructions are a little misleading. I have one in my bathroom and the other in the garage. The garage is a little too close to the sink and it's not in the way. If you are going to use it as"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"These vacuum bags are good quality and the quality is good too.  These bags are very easy to clean and the bags are very easy to store.  I think these bags should be made of a material that is attractive to your eyes.  If you are looking for a good vacuum bag for a child's bathroom, I would recommend these bags.  If you are looking for a good quality vacuum bag, I would highly recommend these bags.I love this pan. I have been using it for a month now and the pan has kept my heat down for about a month now. It is super easy to clean. I have used it a couple of times and it has stayed on the counter for about 3 months. I also like that it is easier to clean than I thought it would be. I also love that the pan is made of metal and the pan is very easy to clean. I would recommend this pan to anyone who is looking for a good quality pan. I bought this pan because I love cooking and I love the way it makes it so easy to cook and clean. I love that it comes"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"After reading the various reviews, I was hoping to try this one.  It's been a couple months and I still haven't found a perfect fit, but it's great.  The color is beautiful and the material is a perfect fit.  I love the way it looks!  I love that it's removable and it has a locking mechanism.  I haven't had any problems with any of the attachments I've used, and they seem to work well.  I'm very happy with this purchase.

I have a few other products that I've had issues with, but none of them have worked as well as this one.  They do have a slight shine, but"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"I received this South Shore Sebastian 4-Drawer chest at no charge, as part of the Amazon Vine program.  However, I always try to review items as if I had actually paid my own hard earned money for them.  With that being said, I do not think this chest is worth nearly the price that it is currently selling for.  It is made of press board.  It does seem durable enough so far, but press board just cannot compare to real wood for longevity and durability.  The hardware is very nice, and looks expensive.  The finish on the press board looks nice as well, although it is obvious that it is not real wood.  The drawers glide easily.

I give kudos to the manufacturer for including wall-mounting brackets with this chest.  The item seems steady enough on our wood floors, but falling furniture is a frequent cause of injury and death in young children.  It never hurts to be safe, so we have all of the furniture in our toddlers bedroom fastened to the wall.

This is not a large piece of furniture.  According to the specifications here on Amazon, it is 30.5 wide x 16.2 deep x 41.5 inches high.  I think it is a good size for baby or toddler clothes, but as a child gets older, it will not have enough storage space."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This strong, light-weight ladder is a big improvement over any of the ladders of its size that I've used before. The tray in the rail at the top is extremely handy for small items -- why don't all ladders have them?"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This is exactly what I was looking for to keep everything organized. If your a person that has a ton of make up you might need 2 but for me it was just the right size.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Works very well, stay stationary and have the right tools. works great."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I love this 24 oz. pitcher, the pitcher is thick and easy to use. It has a nice yet sturdy feel to it, and the pitcher is very easy to clean. I have had this product for about a year now, and it's been working great. The reviews are always a bit misleading because I've had it for about a year now. It has held up well, but I don't think I'll ever use it again. I bought this for my son to use on his birthday, so I will probably never use it again. I'm very happy with it. Very nice, great quality."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"Not pretty. Covered in so many pieces and pieces. Not good enough.Nice, sturdy, and functional.  Great for the price. "
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,They're hex wrenches.  Good length for torque. Ball end for those bolts that you need to get a little angle on.  Lots of sizes.  I got these and the matching metric set and tossed all the odd one-off's I had in my tool bag.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Love these sheet !  These are so warm and comfortable to sleep on during our cold Missouri winters .  I recommend washing these with a half a cup of vinegar along with your usual detergent, the vinegar prevents peeling ."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Easy to install upgrade for older handles. It fits perfectly as a replacement for older Kwikset locks. The finish is nice, and the handle feels like a quality product. The handle is easily reversible, which I needed to change directions for my door. The SmartKey function was easy to use, and worked the first time without a hitch. I ordered two more to replace the other door handles. This is an easy replacement to update your home, making it more modern."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Darn the light over powers the great look of the parrots, look better when off."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"It works as advertised, but the brush is extremely soft and takes more effort to use than I would like.  I guess I just prefer a stiffer brush for my work.  If you have a lighter touch and don't manhandle the brush like I do, it may be a good fit for you.
I had some trouble with the first brush, but the seller was immediately there to try and resolve the issue.  He sent me another brush and assured me that it was a very rare manufacturing anomaly.  He even went so far as to focus on looking to see what may have happened at the manufacturing facility.  I only mention this because if you are even remotely thinking about purchasing this, you can with confidence as the owner/CEO stands firmly behind his invention."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,I bought this to give as a gift. It is a little heavy for my small kitchen and doesn't fit in the
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Yup, another 5-star Kreg product. I love the look and feel of this lamp."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Was well built and arrived promptly.  Felt sturdy and looked great.  However I returned it because it is designed so the hand held shower hangs vertically instead of at an angle.  I didn't want the water spraying directly out from the wall but to angle down.  It would be great to use if you just wanted a bracket to hold a shower head when not in use.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"They are the best for mixing, storing etc.,  I haven't tried them in the oven yet.  I wish the lids fit more snug, but, they're great."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I wanted this automatic toothbrush dispenser for my son. He is 6  with high functioning Autism. Im trying to teach him to be more independent. He knows how to brush his teeth, but has a hard time getting the cap off the tooth paste and squeezing it to get the paste out. When I saw this on Amazon, I knew I had to get it. Plus, he loves animals and the tiger is so cute.

Here are my only CONS:

-It took FOREVER to arrive in the mail.
-The word automatic is a little misleading. When I think automatic, I think you put your brush in and the past automatically comes out. With this you actually put your brush in and push on something and then the toothpaste comes out. It has worked out OK, but I wanted to point that out to potential buyers.
-Directions were a little tricky, as it was in Chinese, but I did find some small print English in there (just took me a while to locate it)

The positives:

-My son can now independently get the toothpaste on his brush and brush his teeth without my assistance.
-The suction cup has help up just fine! It is on our mirror right above the faucet.
-So far, it has been compatible with all toothpastes Ive bought.

All in all, this is cute and decent for the price!

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my genuine review."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"90% of the items I use. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I just can't get the burlap out of the bottom of the plastic lid. The burlap is just a little hard to get out, but it is fine. I don't recommend this item.I bought this as a gift and it has been great!  It is a little heavier than I expected but it works!  I used it to make homemade hash browns, and it works great!  I would highly recommend it.I bought this for my daughter-in-law.  She loved it and she loved it.  It fits perfectly in her bathroom.

I am very happy with the product and am very pleased with the purchase.I have had this product for about a year now. It is very light weight and it holds a lot of water. It is very easy to store and I can use it on my counter top. I will say that I have to be careful with it as it is heavy and a little
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,This unit is actually working better than the one we had before it. The dimensions are just right. The blades are nice and thick and the blades are not so thin as some of the blades we have been using. The blades are very thin and don't seem to have the strength to hold up with a heavy weight. The blades do not have a strong enough grip to make a great counterweight. I am not sure if this is a good design or if it is just a matter of how the blades are spaced. We have been using the blade for a while now and it is still holding up well. We have not had any problems with the blades sticking to the counter and we have not had any issues with the blades sticking to the counter.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,perfect for holding tools and bolts for your lift or as a belt attachment. Hold a ton of bolts or screws . makes our job a little easier

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,i was really looking forward to using these gloves at work. They are unravelling at the base after using them less than a month.  I probably won't buy this brand for tactical/law enforcement use in the future.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I bought this last week because I am working on a 12ft high x 36ft long x 4ft deep childrens playhouse.  There was no way I was hammer nailing all of the roof shingles, trim, etc...  So I went on line and saw this package.  Let me say that it is AWESOME!  It looked brand new.  There was no visual signs of any prior use.  Other than ""Inspected by 3-1"" stickers on everything you would think it was brand new.  I have used over 4000 Finish Nails, and over 2500 Finish nails since it arrived (I haven't used the stapler yet).  It has performed flawlessly.  I am so glad I got it.  It is a great value!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,The scrubber does a good job of cleaning the area. I also love that it doesn't have to be so small. The plastic parts are also very easy to clean.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,CG,"Pros:
Cheap price ($10.88) for all the ones I bought, which is a nice bonus. I have one in my bathroom.  The plastic parts are also very easy to clean.  I used this to make a little makeshift bench outside a garage.  I then placed this on the bench and moved it a bit to make it easier to get the bench to work on.  It has a very nice feel to it and I like the way it moves.  I will buy another"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,CG,"Ok, first and foremost, I wanted a professional quality finish. I chose this for my application as it is a two-piece tool. The tool is designed to be a two-piece tool that is not designed to be a two-piece tool. If you are looking for a professional quality tool, this is the tool for you. I have had many jobs where I have had to replace a tool that has had to be replaced for many years.

However, when I got this tool, I wanted to be able to change out a tool that has had to be replaced for many years and I had to replace it for that reason. I don't want to have to replace a tool that I have used and to have to replace it for years to come. I like the fact that I can change out a tool with no hassle.

The tool is a very good quality and I was very impressed with the tool. I will be purchasing a second set of these for my office and they are going to be worth every penny.

UPDATE: I have replaced the tool with this tool and have had no problems. The tool is now a very good quality tool. I have replaced my tool with this tool and have had no problems. I have also used this tool and it has helped me tremendously"

I was surprised to find that the packaging was plastic, not the clear plastic plastic of the cardboard box. The packaging was well packaged and in good condition. The glue was easily applied to the box and was also easy to apply. I did have to write down the instructions to install the unit."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,I had hoped that this would be the only one in the world that could be used as a shower curtain.  It is.  I have used it a couple of times and it is still holding up well.  I am a bit disappointed.  This is a very good curtain.  I would not recommend it to anyone.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,I already have Dewalt 20V tools and needed to add a drill.  The chuck on this is very smooth and nice for changing bits.  Tightens down easily with out tearing up your hand.  Compact head fits into many tight areas.  Fairly light weight for a drill.  Power has been very good for drilling metal and wood so far.  It does come with a belt clip but DOES NOT come with a spare bit holder on the other side of the tool.  Some Dewalt tools do come with this and some do not.  This one does not.  The battery life has been excellent so far.  Since I am just a home user I can't really speak to if the brushless is really increasing my run time.  I can say it is lasting a lot longer than my Craftsman 19.2V I replaced (Both had about the same amp hour Li-Ion battery capacity).  When they say bare tool they mean bare tool this came in a clear plastic bag.  I will update this rating if my feelings change or I encounter any failures but so far so good.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,CG,"Buy a different brand if you have the time.Very good quality.Nice little light.  Works as advertised.  The plastic parts are very sturdy, and the cover is very sturdy.  The bulb is very bright, which is good for outdoor use.  I would recommend this light to a friend.Worked great for my garage door opener.  I had to use the standard one to get the code to work.  The two wires I needed were identical, so I went with the ones from my garage door opener.  I needed to put the code on the door opener and then it would work.  When I was done, I put the code on the door opener and it worked perfectly.  I would recommend this for anyone looking for a simple and easy way to open a door.

The plastic ones are also not as good, so you get a better quality.  The only thing I like about this one is the price.  If you have the money to buy a different pullover it will be a great deal.

The shower head is also designed to be a little more flexible than the regular shower head.  It feels like a shower head.  This is a great shower head.  I'm going to keep the shower head in the house and it will last for years.  I just wish it came with a different shower head.  I don't know if I will have it for years, but I'm sure I will.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I am a happy customer.  I purchased it when it was on lightning sale.  It's very bright.  I'd placed one on the south side of the house, and one on the north side to compare.  The north side doesn't get much direct sunlight, but I was surprised that it still stayed on a few hours after dark.  The one on the south side probably lasts the whole night (checked a couple of times, was very bright around midnight).  It stays on for a shorter amount of time if it's cloudy/rainy/snowy.  Great service too.  I contacted the seller for replacement because the light sensor on one of the two lights didn't work properly (because it was on during the daytime), the seller responded promptly, and 2 days later I got the replacement set of two."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"As inexpensive as safety comes and they work well. I have been using these when working with power saws and have not had any problems with them. Another reviewer noted some optical imperfections which resulted in blurring and warping of what you see. I have noticed this but it is only very slight. There are other safety glasses out there that will give you a perfect visual field so if that is what you need for your work then you will spend a few dollars more. For my purposes, which include using power saws on mostly wood, grinders on metal, and general purpose, these work excellently."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,"Nice quiet fan. However - it has the design flaw of being a little more noisy. I'm not sure why.  The design of the fan is the same as the fan I replaced.  The fan is quiet enough to be quiet enough to enjoy the outdoors.  If you have a large home with a large fan, it will be louder.  If you have a small home with a small fan, it will be quieter.  The sound level is a little low for me, but if you have a large home, it will be louder."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"I wanted to wait and see what the shipping cost would be.  This is the first one I've seen.  The plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large.  The blades are not in good shape, and the jaws are very stiff"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"I've owned many-a steam mops in my day, and while this is a great mop that heats up quickly and offers a bunch of nice features, I wouldn't pay the hundred and forty dollars they're asking for this. There are just too many other, cheaper models out there that get your floors just as clean.

Now, if you're someone who sees yourself using the detachable handheld all the time, then this may be the steam mop for you. I THOUGHT I would use it all the time, but in reality I only used it once...the first day I got it.

The machine is light and easy to use while you're actually using it, but if you need to set it down, it's prone to tipping over due to it's shape.  The tank seems to go through water faster than other mops I've used, but maybe that's just me. Or maybe the steam gets hotter than other mops I've used, so it goes through water quicker? I don't know, but I do know I have to fill the tank three times to get all the hardwood/tile/stone in my house done.

Overall, would I recommend this mop? Absolutely. I just don't think it's necessary for the amount of money it costs (unless you really want that detachable steamer). There are plenty of high-quality steam-mops out there for much cheaper."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I go through a lot of batteries. I use mainly rechargeables whenever possible. This make it easier to tell if I charged batteries or not. I intended it mainly for AA, but it reads everything, including 9V and button cells.
The only negative is the construction and material, the whole thing feels cheap, but at about $2, it was.
I plan to get a couple of years out of it, if it survives more I'll be very happy."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"The first time I saw ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,"" it was a stage production, and I thought Albee was a fantastic writer.  At that point I had been too young to know the movie, aged by the time I was born, but when I saw it thought, wow, that's it.  With R Burton and E Taylor playing opposite, and caught on film, there was simply no reason to try it again.  I still wonder when anyone does.

These little devices are the same for line voltage connectors as Nichols and team were to Albee's play.  The technology has gone as far as it can.  They cost something, but just after my first installation I'm tempted to run around the house, opening and updating every junction box I can find.

If you read the package CAREFULLY it does IMPLY same quality as Egyptian cotton and lower states microfiber, doesn't exactly come out and say polyester.  Misleading product information.  They're ok for what I paid but I would have preferred that the product information clearly stated what it is.  Also wrinkles.  After initial laundering, original shipping wrinkles present as well as new ones from washing.  I removed from the dryer promptly."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I got a great deal when I ordered this item. In return, I'm making my honest and very reliable information about this queen bed sheet bedding set.

Normally before using a new set of sheets, I washed it first. But with this product I used right away without any hesitation. I can feel it's super soft and made with best quality materials. The sheets are wrinkle free and fits to my queen bed perfectly. It has deep fitted pockets all around so it stays in place and don't slip. It's made of microfiber that will definitely last long.

My husband is very sensitive to dust so I wash/ change our bed linens every week. Hypoallergenic sheet is a PLUS! I was anxious when I threw this Nestl Bedding Set to the washer, thinking it will shrink, pill and wrinkle like my other sheets. But to my surprise, i was wrong! I won't have to deal with sheets pilling and wearing, even with repeated washings. This product is very strong and thick compared to my other sheets. This is way better than my other microfiber sheets. VERY SOFT, COMFORTABLE AND MOST OF ALL VERY EASY TO CARE.

I'm so pleased and so as my husband."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This is my second Moen pivoting paper holder. The first model I purchased was the Moen Wembley Pivoting style. I love how easy it is to change rolls when all you need to do is pivot one end up and remove the empty roll and replace it with a new one.

This model is different than the Wembley model. On the Wembley model only the thin bar rotates up and you can easily slide the rolls on and off--but I found that the bar rattles a bit . On this model the end of the bar that pivots is attached to about an inch wide segment of  the support bracket.  The roll of paper still fits over the segment--and the extra weight on this pivoting end keeps it from rattling.

I really like these pivoting holders. I just wish I had found them sooner!"

I can carry it anywhere, even if I don't have an extension cord.  The cord is very easy to use.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,I have used these wood bits for over two weeks. I used them extensively while building some cabinets. I am very impressed with the quality and accuracy of these bits. In the past I have bought every brand name on the market.

However I placed the bits in another bit holder and chuncked the plastic box. But the bits are a valued purchase.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I can't tell you how much I love these tips! I haven't even experimented with all of them yet, but I love the ones I have played with. One thing to know - some tips require a stiffer frosting and some less stiff. It seems the ones with the little round holes need to be less stiff because if it's too firm, it won't come out of those tiny holes. The best advice I can give you is to wrap your frosting in some plastic wrap, snip off the end, and place that open end down into the bag inside the frosting bag, nestled in the frosting tip. That way, you can change frosting colors simply by taking that plastic wrapped frosting out of your bag and put in a new one, without the big mess of washing out all your bags and tips. Using a frosting coupler inside the bag and having the Russian tip on the outside of the bag helps too, so it's easy to switch out tips! I hope these handy tips help you! Have fun!"

The sound is excellent, and I love that it can be turned on and off without having to turn it off manually.  I also like that the blades are reversible and that it is adjustable for the amount of air you want to use.  The only complaint I have is that I don't like the ""gift"" feature.  I wanted something that would be easier to use, but I didn't want to pay more for this one.  I really like the fact that the blades come with a separate battery compartment for the fan, and the included battery compartment is great.  I also like that the blades come with a separate charger for the fan, which means that I can use the fan without having to plug it in.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Received a first unit DOA and was quickly replaced by Amazon.  Fairly good product and holds temperature properly.  The bracket design for the hot air tool is not very good as it has the tendency to eject the tool if not fully pushed in.  The hot air tool slid down slightly and partially melted the bracket after a few days of use.  The iron is capable of using Hakko tips but the element cover is tight on some of the tips due to the venting holes being punched in.  Using a drill to de-burr the element cover resolved the issue. Other than these issue, this is a very good product for the price."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,CG,I bought this mailbox for my wife and she loves it. She also loves the way the mailbox is so small. I am using it for the first time in a very large mailbox. I have been in a large mailbox for about two years and this mailbox has given me a great impression. I love the way it is packed and the way it feels so much more secure. It does not take up much space and it is easy to move around in the mailbox. I have used it for the first time in a mailbox since I got it. I have a mailbox of about 6 feet in length and it fits perfectly in my mailbox.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"The toilet was making a lot of noise while flushing. I discovered that the similar float unit was leaking. I ordered this part, got it two days later and installed it with no problems. Previously  I had a plumber retrofit all the stop/shutoff valves to the new quarter stop valves. This cost a few hundred dollars, but it is well worth the cost. The old screw turn valves with the spun steel water lines are notorious for leaking after they have been installed  many years and you try and shut them off. The new quarter turn valves eliminate that problem and also come with a high pressure braded steel hose that is easy to disconnect. That made changing this fill valve a snap. I turned off the water at the quarter turn valve, flushed the toilet, got a sponge to dry up any water left in the tank, disconnect the water line, remove the old valve, compare it to the new valve and adjust the height if needed, install the new valve, turn the water on. Check for leaks. DONE!  The new valve works great, and was delivered to my door for about the same price as it would have cost to go to the hardware store."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I am a home roaster and use this filter after brewing coffee in a pan on the stove (4 minutes at 190-200 degrees).  I have a 2 Mazzer grinders, but the Mazzer grinder still created a fair amount of fines - even with a coarse grind.  These fines would sneak past the ordinary screen in a French Press filter and were bothersome for me.

Initially I used a paper filter in a pour-over Hario setup to strain the stove brewed coffee.  This worked decently well, but I wanted to experiment with a good metal screen too.

I like the metal screen (this one) better.  The coffee taste has more body and the oils are more present.  Also, about 98% of the fines are removed.  And, clean up is darn easy.  I just rinse on both sides and occasionally place the filter in the dishwasher."

I ran the PEX down a center column in my garage and to a new air outlet.  Now I have a air outlet in the center of the garage.
Much faster than rigid copper pipe.  I avoided 20 solder joints on 10 copper fittings.  Most in the overhead working off a ladder.

It is comfortable in my hands, sits on the counter in a stable fashion when I am scraping the bowl, and ejects the beaters easily.  However it is not meant for heavy tasks - for that I have a KitchenAid stand mixer (of course).  So I gave it a 4 only because it is not really powerful."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"I loved this cooker, but it inexplicably went dead in the middle of a cycle after just two years of light use.  Given the cost of the item, I am not pleased.  Worse, this failure occurred abruptly after a spendy repair to the steam valve.

Before the failure, I found the device to make reliable rice and risotto. Having perfectly cooked rice in six minutes is definitely a luxury. The browning function made the slow cook feature very convenient- we made several pot roasts and a lot of pulled pork in this.  It was also nice to be able to use the pressure setting as a sort of turbocharge for the slow cooker if things were dragging.

That said, the short shelf life is not the cooker's only failing.  The gasket is fiddly and doesn't always seal properly.  Dirt tends to collect in crevices and it can be difficult to clean.  Finally, the steam valve inexplicably shattered one day, and judging from the other reviews here, this is not an uncommon occurrence."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This rug is awesome. It is so comfortable and the quality is great. It was delivered on a stormy day and survived transport. The rug was wrapped extremely well in layers of thick plastic and the ends capped with thick cardboard. Once I got through all the protective packaging and unraveled the rug I was wondering if I was going to be hit with that ""smell"" that people have mentioned. Nope, no smell. It just smelled like new carpet. Maybe some people have sensitive sniffers?

We also purchased a mat to go under the rug and it definitely added some extra cushion. We have hardwood floors but the rug doesn't slide at all. It's been tested too, our son runs around from kitchen to dining room to living room and the rug doesn't budge.

We bought the beige option. It is a mix of light tan and creme colors, perfect for hiding those potential stains and foot traffic.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"I was in love with this LED bulb until today when I took a multimeter to measure the current draw and calculated the wattage.  It turns out this bulb consumes about 8.0 Watts!!!  That's a far cry from the ""3.6 watts"" claimed on the package.

G7 Power no longer sells this bulb on their website and I wonder why.

This bulb was not the first to misrepresent the energy savings and won't be the last, but I'm just surprised at the big discrepancy.

CFL bulbs are the worst offenders when it comes to exaggerating the actual energy savings.

Some examples of the bulbs I have at home:

G7 Power ""3.6W"" vintage LED actually uses 8 watts.
A no-name ""23W"" CFL actually uses 43 watts
An Ecosmart ""14W"" CFL actually uses 24 watts
A Sylvania ""9W"" CFL actually uses 18 watts
A ""10.5W"" Philips LED bulb actually uses 21 watts.

Most LED bulbs I have are quite accurate in stating the watts, but there are clearly exceptions. The Cree bulbs I got are accurate in the stated vs. actual energy usage.  All my incandescent bulbs are very accurate in the stated energy usage."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"It is difficult to find bulbs that look like the ones shown in the picture.  I have gotten gold bulbs that are called amber, even with GE numbers that formerly corresponded to imprints on bulbs that look like the dark amber ones.  I have also searched imprinted dark anber bulb GE parts numbers and found a florescent bulb.

These bulbs are very price, which is why I gave it a 4 star rating.

One other thing, I found some cheaper bulbs that looked like the dark amber bulb but I decided to call the place to assure that they were the dark amber they had pictured.  I wanted assurances they weren't gold.  I was told that they could not guarantee anything because it depended on the manufacturer.  Sometime the bulbs they got were gold, sometimes dark amber, and they didn't know what they had in stock at that time.  Needless to say I didn't order them.  At least this seller could guarantee they were dark amber."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,Works nicely and keeps things fresh. The lack of the 5th star is due to the way it lines up and a little flimsy. Would recommend though.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,Purchased this to scoop directly from the coffee bag (I think that's what it's called). Problem is that it pushes back in very easily. The extender is pretty much useless.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Wish I had one of these long time ago !  GREAT PRODUCT !
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"It has my seal of approval, and I fully recommend it.  I bought 2 of the Gizmode water alarm detectors, several sensor pad attachments, and 1 sump pump attachments.  Despite their very small sizes and nearly negligible mass, they all worked straight out of the box as I tested everything right away.  I found that the sensor pad attachments were as thin as advertised yet fully effective - they fit quite easily under our washing machine, and water heater.  Though the simplicity of the sump pump attachment surprised me, it was none-the-less very sturdy and worked well, so I placed it intentionally low in the sump so it would sound off just before the pump would activate - and it did.  The alarm was just loud enough to hear on the 2nd floor so my recommendation to Gizmode would be to make it even louder - but it still gets the job done.  It is now at the perfect ""peace of mind level"" where it is high enough in the sump that it won't sound off unless the sump pump fails to work."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,It works perfectly and so much nicer then my old round black one.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Another great, high quality rug I own from Norcho. I love this company! They are great to work with, have wonderful customer service and their rugs are a beautiful addition to our home. We received this awesome animal zoo print one and have places it beside our little girl, Giselle's bed! She has been loving it! It is so fun for her to be able to enjoy the comfort of the rug and use it as a useful learning too while she is beginning to learn how to identify different animals. This rug depicts a hippo, a camel, an elephant and our personal favorite...a giraffe! We actually had a bit of a scare in the middle of the night the other day, when Giselle was sleeping too close to the edge of her bed and accidentally fell to the floor. Luckily for us, we had this rug laid down so it helped tremendously to break her fall. It is very thick and cushioned, so she was able to brace the impact on her head and body! Ironic, but it we felt the rug was meant to be there for her. I will continue to order items from this company in the future! * I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion *"

They were so nice to have. I just bought two more for the shop. This one is still going strong. I love it. I have a few of them in the house and they are bright enough to see. I just bought a second one for the house and they are great. It's very easy to install and works great. I'm going to order another for the kids and it will be just fine.Good quality, but not bright enough.  The soft white light is great.  I am not sure why I would give this 5 stars"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Cuts perfect and last for an extremely long time. We use Freud exclusively in our shop. Best blades on the market. Only thing I would change would be to make them without the red paint. It sometimes transfers to the material that is being cut and has to be sanded off. On the other hand, the red blades look cool. This 40 tooth cuts better than other brands with 90+ tooth blades."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,I have used this on both copper and brass recently with beautiful results.  I use a variety of patina solutions and cost per oz on this one makes it a great value.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I like this item a lot.  Packs up small, nice little case.  I would like to have seen some reinforced grommets but that is a nitpick.  The fact I could fold it back up and get it back in its pouch is enough of a selling point for me.  Good bit of emergency kit."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Reads some reviews but picking this up and shipping it in was a breeze!  I was surprised to find that the packaging is plastic, not stainless steel!  This was a mistake!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,Easy to put together took about 15 minutes solo.  Reasonably comfortable - not the best I've used but I like the look and it seems fine for my home office.  If I was sitting in it 6+ hours a day I'd probably go for something else.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,The pan is just the right size to hold 4 pieces of bread when making French Toast.  The no stick feature is great making clean up a snap.  The aluminum body is rigid and does *not* warp or twist while cooking.  I highly recommend it.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I've had them all. Lenox, Milwaukee, Husky, Kobalt, Irwin etc. This is the best one. One little mod I like to do is take the shaft and bits from the Kline 11 in 1 and put it in the beefier bigger handle of this 10 in 1 to get that extra bit. I don't know why they didn't just sell it this way to begin with but either way this is the best heavy duty multi bit screwdriver you can buy. The handle is literally the perfect size for big jobs where extra tourque is needed, and helps you gain more control for when you need to ""feel"" the fasteners for sensitive jobs where stripping the head or over tightening is a concern. Also the driver is not too heavy or big to be overly cumbersome in a back pocket which is a preferred method of carrying it when I'm running around. The only negative I can think of is the klien oem replacement bits are expensive. You can find similar replacement bits from different manufacturers cheaper, stock up on some of the common ones as you may loose some. Another plus of doing this is you can buy other bits such as the double ECX bits Milwaukee sells and throw that in place of your torx bit or other bit you don't use a lot. You can readily customize this for one big task or just keep the different fastener bits in your tool bag handy so you don't need a bunch of various screw drivers as you can buy almost any bit tip for any screwdriver and just throw them in this screwdriver and still have 6 other sizes in your pocket.

Mine has held up for the last 3 years and the handle, bits show minimal wear. They see moderate to heavy use (no abuse) every day."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Purchased two of these in different sizes. All clad makes great quality stainless steel cooking and bakeware and these are no exception. Heavy and durable, I expect it to last my lifetime or longer."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Perfectly good curved log peeler. Blade comes in 'rough-sharp' condition. The better you are at sharpening, the happier you will be with this. If you can't sharpen, then you'll be happy with something else that comes razor sharp (until it dulls, then you're stuck since you DON'T KNOW HOW TO SHARPEN!!!)

I consider this a companion knife to a larger, straight blade drawknife but very worthwhile at $20."

She has a lot of hair and she loves it. I was excited to get this set for my daughter's first party. She's a huge fan of the matching antique blue and white set. She loves it. This set is a nice size for her, and she loves the very simple design. She is thrilled with how well it fits in her room. She also loves the fact that it has a nice lid. She absolutely loves it. She also likes the fact that it's much easier to clean than a regular laundry bag. I can't imagine getting a better laundry bag. This is a great value for the price. My daughter will love it. Very cute, very well made. Would buy again."

I love the fact that the handle is adjustable and that you can hold it down when you're done cooking.  I also love the fact that you can use the handle for stirring, or just for a quick shake of a bread.  I do like that it comes with a separate lid.  I'm very happy with the purchase!I love it!

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,"If you've ever connected an old AA battery with a new one, or need a new battery, this is an excellent tool to have.  The batteries have a ""turn"" mode, which means that they can be moved around without a problem.

I would recommend this GFCI for anyone who needs a GFCI with a different installation.  This g-wire is the only option available to me for the GFCI.  I would recommend to anyone who needs to replace a GFCI with a different installation.  This GFCI is made of metal and will not rust.

I had to order another set of these for my grandson.  I love the color and they are great!Love this blanket!  It's very soft, cozy, and holds up very well.  I haven't had any problems with it breaking, but it's definitely not a ""scratch"" blanket.  It's just a little too soft and it does a good job of holding up to the hot weather.  I will be buying another set for my daughter as she is having a difficult time sleeping.  We just love it!I bought these to put on my curtains and it was pretty cute.  I bought a couple of them for my son's bed and they are great for that.  The color is exactly as pictured, and the fabric is softer and more soft than I would have liked.

There is a little variation in the top-to-bottom location of the biscuit grooves but I expected to have to sand the top smooth anyway.  As stated in other reviews, the dust bag is useless.  It clogs up immediately.  At least the dust port shoots the debris a little to the side.  Second project was a 14' x 3' cherry bar top.  Again, required some sanding but came out awesome.

Also Bought their hotwheels Chevy SS on Silver chain~garage fabulous!  I live in Florida and every room has ceiling fans (some 2) which most have lights and fan pulls.  These are awesome! Adorable.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I wanted to give this 5 stars but ran into a case where I wasn't even able to get these working. Here's the situation:

These where to be installed at the top and bottom of a flight of stairs. The top switch shared a junction box with another 45609 switch which controlled a different circuit.

I could never get the auxiliary switch to work while both 45609 units were in the same junction box at the top of the stairs.

I eventually called a professional electrician who also failed to get the unit working. He called Jasco support who told him there was likely interference on the Traveler line from the nearby switch that controlled a different circuit.

Nothing he nor I did ever resolved this issue, and i eventually had to put the original switch back in.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I am not particularly tech savvy.  I have ADT house automation with several of my lights controlled by their devices which work just fine.  I thought this may be a cheaper alternative.  It was!  I connected the hub to an ethernet outlet (instead of wireless).  It took a few minutes and it was ready to go.  I downloaded the app and went to every light switch (I had already installed 3 plus 3 remotes) and synched them using with them one by one.  I took seconds for each.  They showed up on the app as light switches that can be dimmed.  The range of the hub is really good.  I have the hub on the second floor and and the 2 of the switches are in the basement.  Overall, I could not be happier.  It all works so well and so far without a glitch.

It's well made, feels great in hand, has USEFUL tools with no frills and all in a profile I can actually keep in my pocket without creating a ridiculous looking bulge. I also REALLY love that the blade and the large flat screwdriver have liner locks. I've owned other Victorinox models that I found myself staying away from because the lack of a lock created dangerous use conditions.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"As other reviewers have noted, the flange holding the foil cutter is highly susceptible to breaking.  Before I even used my device to open a bottle of wine, one of those flanges had broken off and the foil cutter would no longer stay in place on top of the opener. There is clearly a design flaw here. I didn't even bother to try opening a bottle after that.  Incidentally, the instructions accompanying this opener warned that it might not be able to remove some corks, so it would probably be a good idea to hold onto your old corkscrew.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"The bad:  it is a pain to turn on and off with heavy gloves on.  The app is worthless and is incredibly difficult to get the app to recognize the unit even after it is connected in the bluetooth menu.

The good:  the light defaults to the efficiency mode where the light output changes to the darkness around you.  I use the headlamp mainly for walking around outside a warehouse environment at night.  This is the mode i use 95% of the time so this tool does what i need it to do.  Easy to charge and the light on the side changes color as the battery starts to lose power.

The competition:  i also have a couple streamlight headlamps that take cr123 batteries.  They are variable with a lnob and are very handy for around the farm working on equipment and the like.  They are too bulky to fit in my jacket pocket for work (plus require spare batteries) so they don't really compete well for most applications."

Compared to my other bamboo utensils, these are cheap and what I would consider to be disposable.  They are not what I would call ""burnished"" by any means.  The product description uses words like ""beautiful and practical"" and ""impressive"" to describe Joyce Chen tools.  I wouldn't even think those words in connection with the utensils I received.  The surface was rough and uneven, and one item even had visible ""splinters"" on it.  It will only take a few minutes to sand them down and oil them to make decent (not wonderful) utensils, but I am disappointed that I will have to do so.  I would not want to wash these until I sand and oil them.  I think the water would get in and cause them to spit.  Of course, I ignored my own rule... you get what you pay for... and that's what I get.  Next time, I will pay more and get Totally Bamboo products."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I love this vacuum sealer!  So much more convenient than my other large vacuum!  I keep it on the cabinet and use it several times a day.  Not as fast as the big one but so much easier to use.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"I purchased this tablecloth to use on Easter.  I removed it from the packaging and washed it in cold water on the ""hand wash"" cycle and dryed it on low.  It came out completely unusable.  It was full of snags, runs and wrinkles."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Cannot say enough GOOD things about this product. It worked perfectly on our doors!  What a wonderful invention!
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Works great for cleaning out the aquarium, My arm did not get wet at all........and the fish do not seem to be bothered by it......."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"My grandpa got me (and the rest of the grandkids) an economy version one of these on his last trip to Switzerland in the 80s. I still have it.

The one here is different in that the shield is embedded instead of stamped, and it also has a key/lanyard ring. The distinguishing features of this model are as such:

- There are no tools on the back of the knife. While this may be viewed as a negative by some, it gives the advantage that the backsprings are smooth and flush with the back of the knife, and it is therefore more comfortable in the hand, especially during extended use.

- It is the 3-1/4"" size. (closed) This fits better in the hip pocket than the much more numerous 3-1/2"" models. One can barely feel that it is there. If you like the smaller size, but want back tools, the Sportsman adds a corkscrew and reamer to the back, and drops the small blade in favor of a nail file. The Small Tinker (not available here at this time, despite the specs published here) adds a phillips and reamer to the back.

I bought this knife as a whittler. I figured the smooth back would make it more comfortable in the hand, and I was right. One does need to remove the keyring and grind off the nub, though, for true comfort. I also got a little too creative trying to turn the can opener into a specialized carving tool. When I ground off the hook at the base of the tool, that messed up the stop, and now it closed all the way into the handle. It takes an act of God to get it out now, so I kind of ruined the knife. Oh well, it is still good for whittling!

In stock form, the flat screwdriver tip on the bottle opener works well, and the small tip on the can opener works in a #2 phillips most times. Just take care that it doesn't close on your hand."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,"Actually a heavy duty product, but I thought it would be a nice addition to the tool box."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"regardless of the size of the containers, the materials are thick enough to hold a variety of foods.

I had to replace a couple of the plastic plastic containers in the trash"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"This was purchased to replace a standard 3/4"" T-60 that I had in the past.  The old one I had was also designed to be a bit larger, so that it could be used as a fixed size screwdriver."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"This is seriously the best tool I have ever used. I will never be able to get the extra edge from this thing. I am using it for the first time in a long time. I have had no issues with it so far. I have had no issues with the blade falling off and breaking. I have also had no issues with the blade breaking on the first use. I will continue to purchase more of these.This is an excellent product.  It's very easy to install and works very well.  The only thing I wish I'd had was a ""short"" bulb instead of a bulb that would work.  The bulb is only about 1"

These leds are a close color match to the cfl's I still have in the bathroom 8 socket fixture. They use a little less power . They have no Mercury.  So far they have not burned out."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"So far these LED lights worked real well for me.
I used it to light up my entertainment system that way I don't have to use a flashlight to hook up cables
and it's also useful for when the power went out it lit up the living room well.
Only annoying thing is that the UPS kept beeping when the power went out.
Here is what I used to connect it to the LED lights 10pcs 2Pin Quick Connector to DC Female Adapter Cable for 5050 LED Light Strip
and I just used a old power adapter I had from a old corded phone I saved.
My only complaint it's not real sticky on wood even after cleaning the area."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"There are so many kitchen gadgets now that look cute, but really don't do what they promise.  You end up feeling cheated and tossing them out because they aren't worth the storage space they take up.  I'll admit that I figured this would be one of those gadgets.

I remember when the only time we had avocados is when relatives visited from Florida.  Now the stores here carry them, although they are unripe, so you can't eat them immediately.  I had to wait several days for my guinea pig avocado to ripen so that I could test the slicer.

You use the plastic ""knife"" part to cut the avocado length-wise and then you remove the part that isn't sticking to the pit.  This is the thing that surprised me, but the two halves came apart quite easily.  The instructions say to ""press the pitter into the pit.""  I couldn't get the metal parts to go INTO the pit, but they loosened it enough that it fell out when I turned the avocado over.  Job accomplished.

Then you position the slicer over the avocado half and pull it through.  Amazingly, it removes all the pulp in nice, neat little slices.  I've always peeled avocados and then cut the edible part off the pit in irregular slices.  It looks messy and there's a lot of waste. Using the slicer is a big improvement.

I'm leery of kitchen gadgets, but this one does exactly what it promises, is sturdy, doesn't take up much room in the drawer, and cleans up easily after you use it.  It's well worth the modest price.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I love this iron. I'm not sure if it's just me, or if it's a one-off design.  The iron is solid and is easy to clean.  I used this to make a couple of cups of coffee, and it worked great.  I used it for a couple of weeks and then I noticed it had a ""plastic"" smell.  I'm not sure if this is a design flaw, but if it's a design flaw, I'm not sure it's worth paying for.  I'm not sure how much I would have paid for it, but I think it would have been better if it had been thicker.  I would have given it 5 stars, but it does a good job of holding coffee, and the taste is good"

I am using it in the kitchen, in a shed, in a closet, in the hallway, in a bedside table, and in my back yard.  It is a great light, and it has a very low profile.  I've had it for about a year now and I am very happy with it.  I will update this review if I find any problems with it.

Update: I received a new one, which is a very good light, and it is exactly what I was looking for.  I have to say that I had some problems with the light, but I am very happy with the light.  I had a few issues with it, but the light is great, and I have a few other good lights I have purchased over the years.  I would highly recommend this light.

The only thing I would change is that I bought a small size for my daughter's room.  I would not use it for anything larger than a small cup.  I will probably buy a larger size for her room.These are great. I just wish they were a bit longer. They fit perfectly on my bed. I love that they are made of solid wood. I would definitely recommend these to anyone.This is a beautiful mug.  It is a bit of a pain to remove from the bottom of the mug to get it out of the mug, and to do that I have to use a tumbler.  I have a small mug that I put the coffee in, and I have to use the mug to get it out of the mug.  This mug is very well made and looks great.

The only thing I can say is that the plastic lid is very heavy, if you don't get it right it's a little difficult to open.I was excited to get this set as I had never used one before.  I love the color, the size, the quality.  It has a very nice shape and the weight is perfect for my needs.  I like that the very first time I used it I felt my hands shaking, but I've never felt any hand shake or feel the weight on my hands.  I like that it's a little bigger than my other set.  I'm very pleased with the quality and the price.This is a great pillow for a few bucks.  It has a good grip, but it is not as good as a traditional pillow.  I don't recommend this pillow at all.  I have a few other pillow cases in my collection that I like and this is the one.  I'm very happy with it.  I would highly recommend this pillow.Great, very strong, and I like that it holds a lot of items.  I have a ton of items in my closet, and I have a lot of items in the closet.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,This lamp is replacing a smaller 3xAAA type headlamp. I wanted something more powerful and this fits the bill. Will light up an entire room and perfect for doing work in dimly lit places where you need both hands. The only complaint is that you have to cycle through all 4 modes to turn it off. I prefer some other designs where you can turn it on/off back to the same mode depending on how quickly you pressed the button. One thing i may try is putting in an inline on/off switch on the exterior wiring. I've tested pulling out the batteries with it on and reinserting batteries put the light on back on in the same mode so hopefully the mod does what I need it to do.

The hose has a small, rubber ring that helps keep it clean."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I love not having to store and pull out a large machine to vacuum seal leftovers now.  I've used it for all kinds of things and I'm really enjoying how little space it takes up in my drawer (along with the charger).  I like that if you accidentally get a bit of liquid sucked into it the cover comes off so you can easily clean it up.  Plus, it's so light that I can begin sealing liquid filled bags upright so I can avoid this most of the time.  My only issue is not knowing when it is running low and I need to charge it.  I'm guessing it will just die on me, but that would be frustrating if I'm in the middle of trying to seal something or many somethings since I usually separate meals into several bags.  We have a super tiny kitchen so I cannot leave the charger out all the time.  An indication of when I need to charge it would definitely change my rating to 5/5."

Metal doors or door frames block out most of the wireless RF energy radiated from the remote door bell button so many folks complain that the range sucks.  With this kit, you can wire in the transmitter inside your house by your original wired doorbell which will trigger the wireless doorbell when someone presses your old wired doorbell button.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Decent right angle clamp built with aluminum jaws, and steel threads.  Plenty of clearance for getting the joint spot welded, and the center clamping piece 'floats' so it will hold pieces of different thicknesses at a precise right angle.
In fact, the aluminum seems to be powder coated smoothly enough to be able to hold pieces together for things like wooden picture frames, without marring them, at least until you use them as welding clamps and get weld spatter on them.  There is even enough clearance for a nail gun, to tack the pieces together, if you would want.
Precisely made, I consider these to kind of fudge the line between light duty and medium duty as far as welding clamps go.  I checked the angle with a machinist's square, and it was right on.  Great for small or precision projects.  I would even consider them for woodworking projects, where a right angle clamp would be needed."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I have been using this product for more than two weeks now. In that time, I've had an opportunity to evaluate both the quality of the product and the overall usability. In creating this review I've considered both the type of material used in making the product as well as the overall fit and finish. I've also considered how well the product meets my needs and whether there are any shortcomings or particular advantages in using this product.

For this particular product, the type of material used in the manufacture and creation of the product seems to be of very good quality. One must consider that for any product of this type there is a balance between the type of material used and the cost that is to be passed on to the consumer. I think for this product that balance has been met fairly well and I believe that the product will meet the expectations of most buyers.

With regard to the fit and finish of this particular product, I believe it to be about average for the products of similar make or style. That is to say that it is not of poor or moderate craftsmanship/finish nor is it something that I would rate as outstanding. The quality of the piece is such that I feel it is a good value for the money.

Finally, as with many products of this type, the value that a consumer sees is dependent on the expectation. When I ordered this product my expectations were moderate, especially because of the price. In an age where we demand low price but often want high quality, it is often best if we expect moderate to good quality instead. I did that with this product as was pleasantly surprised to find that the quality was at least good, if not just a tad bit better than good. For that reason, and those set out above, I'd make a recommendation to buy this product."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"When I saw how comfortable the model in the picture looked, I knew I had to have one. This pillow is of very high quality, is a good compromise between soft and firm (right in the middle), and is exactly as pictured.

Because it is a larger item to ship, the package was vacuum-sealed, but I had absolutely no problems getting it out and fluffing it to its full potential size. I love how the size and versatility of the pillow's opening allows you to be very flexible with your sleeping options. I am a side sleeper, so I simply adjust the other side of the pillow so that it is touching my back to create a very comfortable cocoon.

The absolute best thing about this pillow is that it stays very cool. I am in Southern California, where we occasionally see 75-80 degree weather in January, so I was very happy to find that this pillow is great at cooling and overall temperature regulation. Overall, a great purchase - this pillow has allowed me to sleep like a baby. The only bad thing about this pillow is that it is not quite as full as I would have liked it, hence my 4-star rating.

The cats and dogs have been loving them for years and now we are happy to be able to enjoy them for a few years.I purchased this showerhead with the intention to use it on the pool, but had to wait a few days to see if it would hold water.  I installed the showerhead on my new showerhead, and it works great!  I would highly recommend this showerhead.I love these lamps.  They are brighter than my old ceiling fan but still work great.  I love the way the light is dimmed, but I like the fact that I can see them in the dark.  I like the fact that they are 3/4 inch thick, which is nice.  I would recommend them to anyone who wants a low profile lamp that is easy to use and is a good value.I really like these lights.  They are good quality, but not very bright.  I have seen some that are very bright, but not very bright.  The light output is very nice and I can see the LED's that are on the side of the light.  I have also seen some that are very bright.  These are not the brightest lights, but they are a good deal.  These are still pretty bright and I am very pleased"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"I got this to replace a standard 3/4"" T-60 that I had been using. It's not the best design, but it works well and is a great light. The only thing I wish it had been a little bit wider was the reason for the two extra outlets. I was looking for a larger outlet and I was getting a lot of cheap plastic so I got this one. It works well and seems to last for quite a while. It's very bright. The light is very bright and works well. The only issue I have is that the ""overhead"" is a bit hard to see, but it's a good thing. I'm not a fan of strobe lights, but this one does. I'm going to buy another one for my bathroom and it will be a good little LED fixture.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"The pros: These snubbers are easy to install; and so far, have helped our 25' 3000# pontoon boat NOT yank the tie-up posts out of the lakebed.  We live on a large inland lake and can get waves to 2' - that combined with stiff winds has caused the boat to break the snaps on the end of the tie-up ropes. We've had no problems since installing these; I'm very happy with the performance and would certainly buy these again (they cost a lot less than those sold at our local boating store).  The million-dollar question is ""how long will these last""?  Can't answer that yet - but after 3 months, they still look unaffected by the weather and sun.

The cons are minor: what WAS a nice bright yellow is now more like orange.  And because these are heavy - they negate the easy line retrieval by using floating rope (everything sinks now) - so we tied empty milk jugs to the ends of the lines to make them easy to hook and grab.  Neither ""con"" affects the overall performance."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"This is what every hand saw should be.  The included saw blade is a must have for every self-defense tool box.  There are some basic tools that you won't find in this set.  It's a little pricey for a saw blade, but it's worth it.  The finish is excellent, the blades are sharp and the quality is high.  I'd recommend this tool set.  I highly recommend it to anyone who needs an accurate saw blade for their tool box.This is my second review of this product.  This one was a great purchase. "
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Here are just some of the things you can do to help keep your hands clean.

- Remove the top of the plastic cap.  The plastic cap is so thin it's barely noticeable.  If you have a large head, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.  If your head is larger, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.
- Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The handle is too large for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.
- Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.

The plastic cap is made of thin plastic.  I've had it for a few months now and the plastic cap is still holding good.  If you need to remove the plastic cap, you'll have to buy a different plastic cap.  Just make sure you have a small, clean plastic cap.

I'm always checking the price of products and would recommend this product to anyone.

One thing to keep in mind is that the plastic cap is not made of plastic.  It is made of a plastic material, which means it's not solid.  If it falls off, you can still get a plastic cap.  But if you try to remove the plastic cap, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.  I would suggest you do this because the plastic cap is so thin, so you can easily get a plastic cap.  This is a good idea"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This Rice Cooker cannot be stopped! I've been using it for over a year and decided to write a review because of all the negative reviews here. For the water bubbling over issue, rinse your brown rice if you don't want it to bubble over. It's more starchy, and it usually says to do so on the package! Also, I've never had an issue with the lid catch not once. Maybe there's some brutes out there that aren't able to care for their appliances. My Zojirushi hasn't had any issues with dependability. Makes rice perfect every time once you get the water amount for your particular rice right. Which is true of any rice cooker. Very simple to use. Two modes, cook, and warm. If you can't operate this unit you shouldn't be allowed in a kitchen because you may hurt someone."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"I owned a memory foam pillow prior to purchasing this one and I love it.  I am older and have a problem with night sweats, so I was looking for a memory foam pillow that would stay cool.  I have to say that I am a little disappointed.  I don't see much difference between this pillow and the pillow that I had, as far as being cooler. In addition this pillow is not as soft and flexible as my first one and I assume that is because of the gel.  If you toss and turn a lot like I do, or suffer from night sweats, this is probably not for you.  However, the price is very reasonable compared to others.  My first pillow was $65, so the quality of that pillow was possibly better."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Works great! Best price and comes with a cover. What a bonus. Connect to fuse box and then hunt no more.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"These are nice lights. I got the warm white 3000K color, and it was what I expected. I am using these for cabinet-top lights in the living room. I got the remote/dimmer, which works as expected. I used almost a whole roll in an area about 1 x 2 feet, and the brightness is not excessive. This was tough, since I needed to make a lot of connections to remain in a tight area.  The HitLights connectors are a royal pain, and you will have an unreliable flickering mess if you need to use more than a couple of them. I recommend you plan to solder your connections. I did, after wasting a lot of time with their connectors."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I have pops of teal and blue, as my accent colors, in my home, so was really happy to come across this piece. It comes with a lightweight wood tray, which can either be used with the tealights, or with something else. Their are 9 tealight holders, in the set, of varying heights, colors and textures. The great thing is, since there are 9 tealight holders, you could actually break them up and use some in other areas too. Also, you could either use real tealight candles, or you could do like I did, and order a battery operated set, with timers, also found on Amazon, and place those inside, so they would come on automatically every night, and then all you have to do is periodically change the batteries. These tealight holders are also great on a window, where they catch the light. If you have a bathroom with a tub, by they window, they would be great on the window ledge, where they would catch the light, during the day, and could be used for ambiance, when taking a bath."

As far as durability, I can not answer that so I sprung for the extended warranty (2 years) for $3. I hope I don't have to use the warranty :-)= . It heats up quickly and is not loud.

Very lightweight so I was able to hang using just the adhesive plastic wall hooks, so that's a plus. Since it's made of plastic, the edges don't sit perfectly flat when I had them laid out on my table to figure out how I wanted to hang them. But since you're hanging them on the little triangular hook in the back, it does lean forward slightly off the wall hook, so you don't really notice the edges. If you're looking to decorate a small wall and not spend too much, then it's not a bad option. Not sure I would buy again but it's decent enough to keep and looks fine in that space."

On other machines I've had, the steam pressure could be directed either toward the filter basket or into the milk frother. Not so here.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I've spent years hitting and missing this whole idea of carrying my shopping bags into the store with me when I go shopping -- so i don't have to carry paper or plastic out with me when I leave...  The Chico-Bags finally fixed the problem of leaving them at home -- leaving them in the car -- having too many or not enough....

since each bag wads up into a little light-weight ball of nothing -- and has a clip -- I just clip one to my bag and leave it there all the time.  I keep half a dozen of them in the back floorboard of the car -- when I stop at the store, I just grab them and clip them onto the one already dangling there as a reminder...  I end up with a multi-colored daisy chain of bags.

When I get home and carry my bags of groceries up -- I just toss the empty bags on the table, and when I sit down with a cup of coffee -- I start stuffing them back into their little pouches, and clipping them back onto my purse.

As long as I never leave without my purse -- I never leave without my Chicos.

Haven't been without them since.

And now everybody I know will be getting them for their birthday....  :D

I keep both the regular shopping bag size for produce and heavy things -- and the Vita size which are much bigger and really good for carrying paper good and chips and such."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Again, I always research well before I purchase. I wanted an easily rechargeable light that would fit inside my PSK Personal Survival Kit in a tin (a Whitman Sampler tin that had chocolates in it). This sits sideways in that tin and is hardly noticible when I pack the other stuff in the tin. Holds a charge a long time and gives up to 40 hours (in the lower light mode) for an emergency condition, or strong light source for short time periods.

Love it. The little rubber stopper that fills up the micro USB connector is hard to pull out."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"This knife is bulky and heavy and not in a good way.  The blade on this knife is really thick and the ""sharpened end"" is pretty dull.  I sharpened it myself and it cuts well, but because it is so heavy it is hard to maneuver or get nice thin cuts of anything.  Even sharpened you have to basically pry an onion open to cut it.  This is definitely not a professional knife by any means."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Necessary kitchen tool, this one was rated high by purchasers, and it works great.  Arrived on time."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"There are currently only a few of these.  I've had mine for a couple of years now and it's working great.  I also have the TRS-38, which is a bit more expensive.  I'm not sure why.  I don't know how long the TRS-38 will last, but I'm sure it will last.  I like the way it is made, but I'm not sure if it will last long enough to justify the price.  I'd rather be buying the TRS-38, which is more expensive.

I'm glad I found this.  I used it to replace the TRS-40.  The TRS-40 is a bit bigger and looks nicer than the TRS-40.  It's a bit heavier, but the TRS-40 is still holding up.  I'd rather have a smaller TRS-40, but I don't think it would be a bad buy.  I would prefer a larger TRS-40, but it's not going to be that much of a problem.I'm very pleased with the quality of this"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Really silky and good feel to it. I have it in a rental and the color hides blood well (hey thats why I buy chocolate). They stand up to heavy washings too.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These are the SOFTEST sheets I've ever slept on! I heard microfiber sheets are better for people w/allergies and they don't trap moisture like cotton sheets, so you don't wake up during the night hot/cold, hot/cold. They are lightweight and seem very well made so I give them 5 stars on both--I'm hoping after a few washings I can say the same about durability!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I love my scale, it is very useful for weighing out portions from large batches. No more guessing. It stores away nicely."

The metal part is well made and will last a long time. This faucet has a lot of power and is easy to install and it will last a long time. I've had it for about a year now and I'm happy with the performance and the price. This is a great tool for small jobs. It works well for smaller jobs. I'm not sure why I got it for this price, but it's definitely a good value. I've used this one to get around a ceiling fan on my garage. I don't know if it's the one that I've had since I was a kid, but I guess I have the right one. I have it mounted in my garage, so I have not had to replace it."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Amazing!  The bulbs are great. Purchased to use in a new arc lamp for our living room. The lamp is positioned behind the sectional and I was concerned about being blinded by the overhanging lamps. These bulbs take the blinding issue out of the equation. The chrome coating reflects the light back up to the ceiling while providing comfortable ambiance while sitting under the light.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"As far as I understand, it is an inexpensive bulb but it works well for the price.Great product. Great price. I am using it in the kitchen to cover a large dining room. It is great for reading. I am very pleased.I bought this to replace a broken one"

They allow for full use of your hand. They make everything so much easier and convenient! I am happy to recieve this product to review.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,This is by far the best set I've ever owned. I also have a few other tools that are not the best but I think they're worth the money. I've been using these for years and they are still working well. This one is still going strong.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,These work great.  It would be nice if they had a brightness setting.  They are very bright and it would be nice to be able to tone them down a little.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Wow. I cna not believe I have left my ears that exposed for so long. talk about reducing noise. Routers, table saw, shop vac...etc. These are great. It was a little tight on my head at first. I wear a size 7 fitted cap, but I just bent them out a little bit and now they fit snug.

THey are not so comfortable that you will forget that you are wearing them..but they really do the job they are intended for. Two thumbs up for this product-

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I was very nervous about ordering a rug online because this is a purchase I would normally want to see and feel before buying.  But when I requested that Lowe's bind a 9x12 area rug and they said it would cost $1,000 (even though the rug itself was only $300), I decided I needed to shop around.  This large rug was only $360 and it is ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!  The color is perfect; it's soft and deep; it's really perfect!!  I would recommend highly to anyone.  You won't be disappointed!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,It feels cool to the touch but is super hard.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I have a very-sound sensitive 8 year old child (as in, have had to flee any fireworks, gun shots, or anything even mildly loud since she was a baby).  Having a set of earplugs (that can be put in by her unobtrusively) and a set of ear muffs (when she is too scared to be self conscious) is a sanity saver for all of us.

The small version fits her and her older sister perfectly, and is slightly small for my normal head sized-husband (way to small for giant-headed me).  But with an open floor plan, I think I am going to get some bigger versions to have around the house.  I realized they could be invaluable if the girls ever start humming tunes from Frozen when we are trying to read.

PROS:

Very comfortable (size small works for my kids, get larger for adults)
They (semi) collapse to a somewhat smaller size (though do not fold down completely)
Solid (I can thrown them into a backpack without worrying about them)

CONS:

Would be great if they folded down all of the way"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Love the look, but it's a little flimsy...though honestly, I suppose that's fair for the price! I'm returning this one and ordering a larger and higher quality version!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"The Zojirushi NS-VGC05 Micom 3-Cup (Uncooked) Electric Rice Cooker and Warmer, Garden, Lawn, Maintenance DOES EVERYTHING!
Set the timer for it to electrically cook rice then do the garden and lawn maintenance. How they managed to engineer this tiny thing to do it all is beyond me. If they had put half as much effort into writing the verbiage for this unit we would all be blown away.
Just plug it in, throw some rice and a splash of water, press the button and BOOM! the lawn and garden is perfectly maintained! Who would have thought this could all be done with a rice cooker?!

All I can say is THANK YOU Zojirushi or whatever you call yourself. You should do stuff for NASA, or at least the defense department. If that were the case we would have a toaster oven baker ice cream maker, terrorist taker outer, and HumVee washer all-in-one unit."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I received this item free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I love how cute they are! My kids are been choosing their molds for their eggs and pancakes every single morning. They really seem to enjoy choosing their shapes and eat all of their food. My kids needed that little extra push to get them to eat all of their food. The silicon molds are BPA-free and made of flexible yet durable 100% food grade silicone and can withstands temperatures of -20 F to 450 F. They do not stick to your food too much so it makes it really easy to separate your food from the mold. I still sprayed mine with coconut oil out of habit when I use them in the morning. It is very easy to clean and store as well. I keep them in a Ziploc in the drawer. I am sure you and your children will loves these as much as my children and I do.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Worked great for several ceiling fans that require multiple expensive pin base style bulbs in one of our rental units.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This is just like what my mom used when I was growing up. Every time I use it I feel like she is in the kitchen with me.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Cheap and works well. Bright enough to illuminate the path in front of you, or use one of the other options, if you prefer a flashing red or white light. It cycles through the options by clicking the power button, so turning it on and off is less than ideal. After much profound consideration, and consultation with philosophers and theologians, with scholars of law and jurists drawn from all regions of space and time (including several denizens of the Citadel of Ricks), I have decided to award this headlamp four stars."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I must have been cooking pasta now for the past 20 years, and I have always boil the water in a big pot and cook it that way. I had no idea something like this even existed. Cooking with the microwave was a new concept for me, because I only used it to re-heat stuff.

I was very skeptical at first, but based on so many good reviews I had to give it a try. The first time I used the Fasta Pasta The Microwave Cooker the pasta came out fine, but had a small section that was still under cook. Knowing this, I added 30 seconds to the cooking time next time around, and it was perfect the second time I used it.

This saved me so much time, and a lot easier to clean! Wow!

My only regret is not being exposed to this product years earlier. Highly recommended!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Really like the larger cutting board. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to find.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,I bought this to replace the carbon monoxide detector in the RV. I looked up the model I had and didn't want to pay over $70 for it so I researched alternatives and this model came up in the RV forums to purchase. It is smaller than what we had in size but I like the smaller size better. It came with the battery already installed so I had to do was pull the protective plastic strip and it worked right away. I did press the test button and everything seems to be working great. I will be using this as my replacement from now on. I am glad Amazon carries them at a good price.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I like my fingers at the original length and position. This helps to keep them that way, and the magnetic feature keeps it handy; stuck right to the side of the saw table, next to the face shield and the hearing protectors."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,"This tool did what it was designed to do, and I will be purchasing more. Very nice. I bought this to replace the Schlage 32-60-8 bulb that I replaced with this one. It works great, and the size is perfect. I used it for the kitchen and kitchen tables."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"First of all these bowls are beautiful. Shiny, sturdy stainless steel. Couldn't ask for more. To start with, the price is right .... I bought them for my bread making needs and they do the job. They are made in India and anything made out of stainless steel in India is usually good. I definitely recommend them. They will last a long time and as per my experience will not rust or deteriorate.
Would give them more stars if they were available."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,The green bulbs lasted all day. The only problem is that they are only a couple of hours.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I prefer these because they are lighter weight than some of the higher capacity batteries on the market.  In things like saws and drills, I'd rather use a lighter tool so I can be more precise.  They charge so fast that you can just have a few on hand and swap them out as needed.  The only tool that eats through them quickly is my circular saw- the drills can drill hundreds of holes or drive hundreds of screws before needing changed.  If you are using it in something like a light or a vacuum, where weight is not a factor, I'd go for the higher capacity heavier batteries."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,"Never used these, but have been pleased with the quality. I will keep them in the shop and use them for painting"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Excellent Bulbs.. I have bought more than 20 of these.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"These potholders are somewhat thin, and have a tendency to peel off after a few uses.  However, I found them to be very sturdy.  The potholders are very sturdy, and are well worth the price.  I would recommend them.Very nice!  The reviews said it was a great pan, but it's not.  I had to add a second one because I just didn't want to put the pan on the counter top.  I would not have ordered it if I had known I'd be using it.  This pan is well made, and very sturdy.  I am happy with it, and it's a great product.  I am very pleased with this purchase.Very nice to have them for those times when you don't want to have to wash them all!Easy to clean."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"A month after I purchased this I gave it 4 stars.  Today I will give it only one.

The pan is great, a bit tinny so it warps easily but pretty good.  The problem: The rack in NOT Stainles and ""rots.""  See photo.

You can see corrosion from chicken and pork?  See exposed copper which was used as an inter-plating before chrome plating.  Now regular steel wire costs about $1/lb and Stainless Steel costs about $2/lb.  Therefore, for being miserly, by not using good materials two things happen: 1) In ordinary use the plating breaks off meaning you may be ingesting both chrome and copper (ingesting iron won't hurt you, and actually the copper won't either, but I don't really know about chrome.  C'mon Manufactuer spend $1 more and raise the price $2 and give me a pan WITH A RACK that lasts.  The manufacturer says stainless steel pan so is semi-honest and so gets one star.  I'm disappointed."

I love the the easy button switch to stop the water temporarily.  Say I want to fill a pot on the counter.  Turn on the water, grab the head, push the stop button, and no splash or wet counters.
 I've had issues with other one handle faucet designs shutting off by themselves.  The faucet I replaced would only stay on if I had the water on full blast.  This handle does not do that.  Now I can peel eggs under water easily.

I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a great quality tool.Great product!I use this to cut a nail and it works great!  It's easy to use and works great.  I've used it on the nail base, along with a nailer, and it's a great addition to my kitchen.  I used it on a nailer, which was a lot less work than I would have liked, but I don't think I would have purchased it for the nail base.  It's a great tool, but the nailer is a bit too large for my purposes, so I have to buy another nailer.  I like the nailer a lot.  It's a little bigger than I would have liked, but it's not so big that I would have had to use it.  I'm going to use it on a nailer, but I don't think I would have purchased it"

I highly recommend this tool and will buy more of them. Very nice quality. I have a 6 footer and a 25 footer.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I had gone through 2 ""cheapie"" scroll saws over the past several years. I do a fair amount of fret work and intarsia. I finally have a machine that holds the blade tightly and is easy to thread into pilot holes.the blower works great. Having the arm tilt is an invaluable feature for me. I am not crazy about the hold down...the arms are too far apart for some of the small work I do. But other than that, a fantastic machine, and getting the stand free is a great incentive. A built in light and blade holder would nice added features.

I just completed cutting and building a very intricate clock that was all fret work with this saw. It's outstanding to operate. Changing the blade and re-tensioning from one hole to the next is fast and easy to do. I like the extra long air hose on the saw; it does a nice job of keeping the work area clear of dust when cutting and it adjusts easily. This saw also runs very smoothly and quite. If you enjoy doing fret work or making small detail cuts this is the saw to have."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"It dims, it controls a fan with more than 3 positions, it has a remote control, what more could you want?!

Oh yes, CFL/LED control. I'm surprised they haven't brought those features over to this model yet, the main issue being that the CFL/LED dimmer models allow give more range on the lower-end of the scale, where those lamps usually tend to need it to give a smooth dimming range. I swapped over to halogens to retain the dimmable range and save a bit of power, but be aware these won't work as well with CFL/LEDs as their certified dimmers will."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Up front, these lights are not mellow yellow, they are WHITE. But, it you need a good bright white light in your room, these are the ones you need.

LED's are more expensive on the front end, but the decreased operating costs are supposed to pay for these lights over time. Another factoid that most people do not realize is that the newer ceiling fans with lights will NOT take any bulb over 60w. If you have a three light fan, then that is 180 watts total, two is 120 watts. If the light shade is anything but white the light will be dimmed accordingly. Not knowing that, we initially had two CFL's in the lamp but soon found out that the room was really dark at night. I purchased these two bulbs that are both each equivalent of 100 watt incandescent bulbs and I was surprised how bright they are. The only problem is that the light comes out of the LED bulb somewhat directional due to its design, if you look at it the light bulb design the light bounces out of the white cover on top of the bulb. For a floor lamp or a desk lamp this design would not be a  problem, but since my application requires the lamp to be inserted at a horizontal direction (instead of top to bottom as you would in a table lamp) the light tends to not diffuse through the shade as well as a CFL or an incandescent would, instead it directs the light towards the walls instead of the ceiling. I think that you will get used to the light after a while. Ideally a LED that illuminates at a 360 degree axis like a CFL or incandescent would be better.

The white light is also something to get used to. It is much brighter than the CFL's and incandescents and more appealing especially if you are a reader or have evening low-light sight problems."

I know that I saw a few pairs of long latex gloves for less money, but I really don't think that they would hold up to use the way these nitrile gloves do. The cotton lining helps keep my arms warm when I'm working in cold water. Really they are just perfect for my needs. Size wise, I'm a woman with pretty long arms and these come all the way up to my armpits, and will even go over sleeves. I highly recommend these!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,My son loves to eat his meals and play with toys on this table but it's definitely flawed for the draw-on purpose. It's a soft top table and chair set so it is very easily punctured. It would have been better if it were actually a hard dry erase board surface. During the first use we could see that the markers it came with were actually staining the table after being erased so we might try Expo pens instead. His light weight toys were leaving indentations also (see photos.) Not a good idea to use pens/crayons/pencils unless the paper is under a hard book. Very simple open and close mechanisms that lock for safety. Other than the flawed drawing board aspect it's very useful/light weight and sturdy.

But that is the reality and I am not willing to have to buy a whole new drill rig because it seem more economically feasible to do so instead of buying a battery that is about half the cost.

Well with this Pwr+ second market battery you don't have to any longer. After getting a case of sticker shock at the local Home Depot for a replacement battery for my DeWalt drill I thought there had to be options. There are and I found it right here.

Now there are multiple batteries available on Amazon for the DeWalt drill. So, how did I settle on this Pwr+ battery. I spent some time reading the product reviews and ultimately found that this particular aftermarket brand had high ratings and pleased customers that stated the battery not only charged well, but lasted as well.

For less than $30, I purchased this battery and received it within two days. (I have Amazon Prime). It charged and worked as I expected it to. You cannot go wrong with this battery and it has served me well thus far."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"Understanding that all wax seals will eventually fail, I researched the alternatives and purchased this Danco seal and a Fluidmaster rubber seal - in case one didn't work properly. The toilet it was to be used with is about a year old and is from the American Standard ""Mainstream"" family.

The floor is tiled and level. The toilet flange is the newest PVC flange that Oatey makes, is ""above the floor"", and level.

The specs on this Danco seal state that it will work with flanges that are ""above the floor"", up to 1/2"" tall.

This seal didn't compress enough to allow the toilet to sit flush with the floor. It just rocked side to side. There was no error with the installation as the toilet was repositioned several times to ensure that a proper ""set down"" onto the Seal was made. There just simply wasn't enough room between the outlet on the bottom of the toilet and the top of the flange for this Seal to fit into.

You know what worked? The cheapie old Harvey wax ring. Prepped and placed the toilet down the first time and flush the toilet sits.

Maybe this Danco Seal works for some combinations of toilets and flange heights - but if you want to save yourself some grief, purchase and have on hand the good ole' wax ring just in case you're in the predicament I was in.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I ordered this on Amazon Prime Day!  Item was delivered promptly and I regularly cook eggs with runny yolks in this pan.  I did not want to write my review too early until after I had used this pan on a regular basis.  I did stick a post-it note on my range for the family to take note to never put this pan in the dishwasher and to only use PLAIN WATER and a scrubby sponge or paper towel to wash this pan.  The instructions say to not use lemon-based dishwasher detergent to clean it.  I guess I have taken that a step further with only using water to clean it.  Sometimes I have just heated up a little water and then turn the heat off and let it sit.  This has been working and the non-stick surface is still very much intact.  So far, by doing this, it has performed better than any other non-stick pan I have ever owned.  I have not treated my past non-stick pans this way and they have ended up being recycled.  Tonight I cooked chicken breast tenders with MCT oil and garlic and rosemary and they turned out very tasty but f I usually only cook eggs in it.  I am babying this pan and I love it and it is still beautiful!  Never use non-stick spray in a pan like this and the instructions for this warn against using olive oil which I am taking to heart.  Real butter is okay and a little goes a long way!"

The storage inside is divided into 3 removable trays. You can put a lot of tools, gardening equipment, etc. inside. My favorite part is the removable power cord with 4 outlets.

The garage doors have a plastic ""turn"" light switch that allows the door to turn in and out of the garage. This switch is a great feature for the garage door opener.

I installed it in the garage door opener by using the light switch. I was able to pull the door open by pulling the door close with a thumb and then push the button to turn it on. The light switch will turn the door on when the door is in a closed position, and when it is open, the door will turn on. The light switch is made of plastic, and the light switch does not come with a case. The light switch has a rubber band that allows it to be removed from the door by removing the plastic band. The light switch is on a low voltage circuit that runs from the battery to the switch. The light switch is a single button on the side of the door, and the switch is made of plastic.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"This is the worst purchase I have ever made from Amazon. I have had the mattress for several days, opened and laying on my bed frame. It is supposed to be a 6 inch mattress and won't inflate beyond 4 inches. I got tired of sleeping in a recliner and tried to sleep on this thing last night. After an hour of being completely uncomfortable, I put my old two inch foam topper on it and tried sleeping again. No go. This thing gives and doesn't bounce back. It's like sleeping on a board. I am sore all over after my two attempts at trying to sleep. I am contacting Amazon for a return/refund. Don't waste your time buying thing thing, even for a guest room -- your guests will hate you if you do! And, when it was opened, there was a stink in the room coming off the mattress. It off gassed for two days. I received this in Nov, 2017 and the tag on the mattress said it was made in China in Sept, 2016. So it was manufactured, then rolled up tight for over a year. No wonder it doesn't inflate. I am very, very disappointed in this. UPDATE: I returned the mattress to Amazon. There was no hastle, arranged for UPS to pick it up and the refund to my account was issued within 2 hours of being picked up. The hardest part about the return was rolling up the mattress (it was very stiff in the middle), tying it off, wrapping it up in the plastic it came in and then taping card board all around the plastic. I probably didn't have to do all of that but I did it anyway, just to be sure it arrived in one piece. Don't  waste your money on this product."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"The work light work OK so far. It charges via USB charger (they include both wall and car chargers). The charging port does not have a cover, so I am afraid it will get dirty or wet and it will prove fatal for the light.

The three moving lights can either be folded along the main body of the flashlight, or they can be spread out, but they cannot be brought up more than 90 degrees to the surface and cannot concentrate all four lights on one spot. I found it irritating, especially in tight spaces, where it would be nice to fold one of the sides more to the center to fit in a light corner. The magnet is strong enough to hold the flashlight horizontally, but just barely - it is very easy to knock it down.

The battery life was relatively good so far, and it charges rather fast, too. When the battery gets low, it turns off without any notice. You can turn it on again for a few seconds to find a charger. It does not charge and light up at the same time - if you plug it in and turn on, it will not be charging at all. Empty battery will stay empty battery.

The most irritating thing is that it has one button for multiple modes. When you first turn it on, it only lights up the end, as a regular flashlight. But when you are done, and want to turn it off and press the button, it lights up the three sides, effectively blinding you, unless you unfold the sides and direct them away. It needs on power button and one mode button."

When set to the most sensitive setting, the lights were picking up passing cars on the street, so I had to use the mid-range setting, which detects moving objects on my property but not in the street.

Several reviewers had luck at Lowes, but I did not. After a lot of research and buying several bulbs that didn't fit, I found that the bulb has a European base, which is not easily bought in the US. The base size needed is E14, and standard candelabra bulbs are E12. So I searched on Amazon and found a converter that allows an E12 base bulb to fit in an E14 socket. I got a 6-pack of converters for less than $8 and bought a pack of E12 base candelabra 25-watt bulbs. And it worked perfectly! The light is a little bit brighter with the new bulb than it was before.

I'm so glad I got the bulbs to work because I really didn't want to get rid of this light. Not only because I love the light, but because it screws into the wall and I didn't want to have to worry about covering up the holes :/"

It's stainless steel so it will match any kitchen decor. It's very attractive so it can be displayed on the table or put in the cabinet with the spices. It's pretty lean so it won't take up much space but it held more oil than I expected.
I put Olive Oil in it (not the person) and it won't great. It was easy to spray after one or two priming pumps. The oil comes out in a line, I wish there was a way to make it have more of a spray but the oil does come out very easily. So I used the olive oil as a pot coating like a cooking spray. I could also see this being nice for salad dressing oils because it will limit the amount of dressing put on the salad.

I had a similar design before and used the Tumbler to bring it to work. I still use it every day, and it's great. I like the shape of the lid, but it's a bit heavier and I can't really hold it on the top of the container. It does hold a lot of stuff, but it's not a perfect design for me. I have to get something that is smaller. I really like that it has a ""stiff"" lid.

I like that it's removable, but I can't really tell from the design that I should have it to do that. I can't think of a reason not to order it. It's also a little hard to pull off the lid after you've washed it. I'll have to try and get something that works. I've used this before, and I really like it.I love this little spatula.  It is very easy to use, it has a very smooth surface, and it holds very well.  I would recommend it to anyone.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I bought these despite a previous reviewer concerned with the ""cheap plastic"" not being able to ""dissipate heat"".  The  reason you SHOULD by these lights is because there's no heat to dissipate! That's the beauty of LED's: instead of making light and heat like the halogen lights we're replacing, LED's just make light, hence the energy savings. BTW., if the reviewer is that worried about heat dissipation, he should hurry up and get these because the old halogen lights in recessed ceiling cans get way to hot for my comfort level. Even the heat protection devises to make them safe for installation in attic spaces don't do that good of a job.

Not sure why he had such failure. I'm not sure if LED's can be used outside, in wet exposures. Curious to know how the guy who said they fit in the Malibu (exterior) lights from the boxed store are holding up! I hope well...these would save me a ton of money if I can replace those as well!!"

I would say the markings are approximate so it's best to have a separate inexpensive humidity monitor so you know the humidity level is where you want it.

(My previous countertop had a soap dispenser in the granite top which was wonderful so I'm coming from a place of being used to pumping soap rather than handling a bar.)  This dispenser was easy to install and easy to fill.  No drilling is required as it comes with mounting tape and silicone.  The pump itself was easy to prime (which is necessary when you add a thicker soap for sure).  I purchased the dispenser with the satin nickel-like finish; however, the finish is a bit ""cooler"" than traditional metal satin nickel finishes.  Note the pix where I show the ""warm"" satin nickel finish of my faucet vs. the ""cool"" satin nickel finish of the dispenser.  And, I took a star off because the description indicated I was buying a dispenser with a satin nickel-like finish; however, the pump button itself has a shiny chrome-like finish.  I don't know why they couldn't have made the pump button satin nickel finish as well!  All in all it works great so functionally it's 5* but cosmetically it gets 4* and the seller gets 1* for not listing the chrome button on its web site."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I have been using the Intermatic EI600 switch. It has worked great, varying the on/off times according to seasonal latitude. It is roughly accurate, shortening on time in the summer, and lengthening in the winter. Since my older home does not have a third wire to power the memory, I would have to replace the included battery every few years and have to re-program every time. I found this programming to be unintuitive and time-consuming. The newer EJ600 has a rechargeable battery so you do not face this onerous task.

Now we have the Philips 429746 CFL 900 lumen sensor light (about 60W equivalent incandescent). Simplicity itself: on when it is night or very dark overcast, on when it is dawn.
There has been NO flicker even though there is a very bright light within sight on a neighbors porch. This had been a bane when I tried screw-in sensors.

Advantages:
-simplicity
-not fooled by most bright artificial light
-sensor direction has not been critical
-lower profile than one of those sensor-equipped sockets you screw a regular bulb into. It will fit inside virtually any glass enclosure.
-my glass enclosures are a fairly dark amber, and this has not fooled the sensor
-no need for smart switches or timers.

Disadvantage:
-not LED.
-sometimes there is an on-off flickering at dusk for a minute, but rarely longer.

I have removed my 3 Intermatic switches and just leave the switches turned on. I presume it draws minimal electricity, just enough to power the sensor.

Just bring a 2nd along for the delicate items so they can be bagged separately."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"There are several choices when it comes to cooking utensils: Stainless remains my favorite choice given that it is dishwasher safe, sturdy enough to hold up under force, and thin enough that it can easily get under the cooked product. Silicone, also dishwasher safe, has the advantage of being good for teflon-coated pots and pans but the disadvantage of rarely being tapered sufficiently to get under, say, a sunny-side up egg, without damaging the appearance of the food. Bamboo is a great alternative; though you have to hand wash wood utensils, wood is generally stronger than silicone and can still be used in teflon-coated cookware. The trick, though, is that it has to be cut properly.

This set could have used a little more in the finish department. The colored handles are a nice touch, but the half that touches food is rough to the touch, not quite sanded sufficiently, and doesn't come to as thin an edge as is necessary on the spatula tools. Further, the slotted cuts on two of the utensils had left a few bits of little wood splinters that I needed to make sure were thoroughly removed when I first cleaned the items. The wood was also finished with a light outer coating - some type of urethane? - that wasn't smoothly applied. There are areas which lack the coating, and some areas which appear to have blotches and extra coating.

So overall, the set is ok, particularly as a lightweight set for a camp or RV stove, but at home you would likely be better served with two or three higher grade utensils than this set."

ADVANTAGES:  It's easy to put the two halves together by matching tabs to slots. It has a hinged cover over the lock, unlike the Safety 1st which has just an opening. Once assembled, it generally prevents children from turning the doorknob while allowing adults to do so by simultaneously pressing the two ""levers"" on the sides and twisting. DISADVANTAGE #1: A child might be able to separate the two halves (although this item is more resistant to breakage than the Safety 1st covers). ""HACK"" #1: Use a strong glue (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Henkel-01-82196-Loctite-2-Gram-Super-Glue-Gel/dp/B000ALBZGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Henkel 01-82196 Loctite 2-Gram Super Glue Gel</a>) on the tabs to keep the cover intact (but not so much glue that you won't be able to remove the cover later!). DISADVANTAGE #2: On certain doorknobs, the rubber-like pads inside the cover might grip the knob too tightly, so that a child will be able to open the door with only moderate effort. ""HACK"" #2: Apply a small amount of silicone lubricant (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10141WD-11oz-3-in-1-Pro-Lubricant-Silicone-Spray-Aerosol-Can-SHIP-GROUND-ONLY-ORM-D/dp/B000BBYCUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10141WD 11oz 3-in-1 Pro Lubricant Silicone Spray Aerosol Can *SHIP GROUND ONLY* ORM-D</a>) to the pads inside.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"An all in one idea sounds perfect but fails horribly.
Here's all the things that aren't good first:
1. Many parts to clean every time one brews
2. Condensation in the grinder causes coffee grind caking
3. 'Finished brewing' five beeps goes off and there's still 1/4 of the water left in the\ machine

If any of these things go wrong, it leads to big messes and weak coffee.
Way too many things have lead to mornings ruined.  After one spends 5 minutes and 10 gallons of water rinsing all the parts, you have to take this top mechanism piece of cheap plastic off the basket, rinse that, dump the basket, rinse that, check that no grounds are at the bottom of the basket holder, take off the carrafe's lid, check that no rogue grounds are stopping the shut off valve from letting the coffee run.  If you're tired and forget to empty the basket after being distracted from all the other steps, it over flows.  WHen the water collects in the system from not completing brews, you make a pot of coffee and it overflow. Grounds stop the basket hole, it overflows, the shut off valve's stuck with grounds, it over flows.  Think it's working well?  Check behind your counter, there's probably gallons of brewed coffee that has escaped and you don't know it!

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"This doorbell system has a LOT of potential.  What I've found, though, is that it does NOT seem to like cold weather.  I went through two sets of batteries in two months.  I learned and bought a large set of batteries through Amazon to accommodate the cold weather months (I live at 5,000 feet elevation).  Customer service is EXTREMELY prompt and courteous.  After my first doorbell transmitter blew through a set of batteries in under a month, they replaced the unit.  The second unit's battery door doesn't shut all the way and I had to tape it shut.  In 'normal' temperatures, it seems to be fine.  But when the battery starts to go bad, the doorbell will go off on its own randomly, many times in a short span of time.  There is no other way to tell if the battery is dying, other than that or missing guests :(  I'm going to keep using this system, though, knowing what I know about it.  The price is unbeatable, you get what you pay for, and I'm sincerely hopeful that they can improve the design for future models, because the chimes are fine (I use the default 'ding-dong, ding-dong' one) and I'm alerted to guests in a building out behind my home where I cannot otherwise monitor the front door.  NOTE: because this doesn't exactly look like a doorbell to guests, I applied a printed label that I made with my label printer (black text on yellow tape) that says ""DOORBELL"" on it and applied it to the surface of the transmitter to alert people to the bell.  Guests verified that my label alerted them to the existence of a doorbell as they would otherwise not have known I had one because it blends in to the white paint on my house."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Too bad I need only one of these. Not sure how long they will last but they are a great value. I will be ordering more as I use them to cut large spaces. I had this on hand for a couple of years. I was worried it would not work with the Makita DeWalt 11-volt batteries. However, it did work perfectly. I will be buying more. Works great. I'm very happy with it. This is a great tool for small jobs. It works well, but I use it with my hand tools. I have a drill press, and a hammer press that does the job. I use it with my hand tools, and I like it. I have to keep it in my pocket for when I'm going to use it. Also, the little screwdriver that comes with it is a nice size. I don't recommend this tool to anyone unless you have a large hand. It's not for a drill press, and it doesn't seem to be very handy. I think it's a good tool for smaller jobs, but for more expensive jobs, it's not for the job."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,Nice solid machine.  The only negative is it's under powered.  Slows down when sanding large planks. Great for small piece sanding.  You just have to let the machine do the work and don't push to hard.  Great for the price.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"It leaks, it leaks!

Dang.

My office chair, which gets heavily used, would settle slowly towards the earth in the course of a day. And then need to be raised again. So I replaced the cylinder with this one with this one. Removing the old cylinder just took one good whack, then installing this one was easy, everything fit nicely.

Unfortunately... my chair is still settling slowly towards the earth. Not as fast. But still doing it.

Oh well.

I will try again with a different manufacturer. I will modify this review if it turns out that it's somehow the chair's fault, rather than the piston's fault."

I have a few of these in the house and they are a little heavier than I expected.  This one is a little heavier and I like it better than the other ones.  I have them on my garage door opener.  I love that they are bright and small.  I will be buying more of these.  The one I have is great.  I am very happy with it.  I have to say it's not bright for my needs.  I have a couple of my other lights with LED's but this one is about a third of the price and the other two are half the price.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I bought this food processor a little over 3 years ago and have been very happy with it the whole time.

About a week ago, I had a problem where it wasn't assembled properly and turned on anyway: it should not have been able to do this, it damaged itself and posed a safety hazard in doing so.  I called Customer Service, and explained the problem, and, within 10 minutes, the helpful representative on the line had agreed that it shouldn't do that, and that they would send me a new unit, along with a prepaid shipping label with which to ship back the damaged unit and that it should arrive in 3-5 days.

A company can't entirely prevent malfunctions.  This is the best customer service experience I have had in years.  I recommend KitchenAid products on the strength of this experience alone."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Is there a reason to NOT love a Mora?
This is just as it appears to be in the photo & stats.
Mora is synonymous with ""consistently great affordable knives"" and this one in particular is no exception.
Because of it's narrow, short blade, and high Scandinavian grind, this basic wood carving knife is perfect for carving.
One of the reasons most wood carving blades are short is for control of the blade, enabling the holder to make precision cuts, and requiring the user to take their time with small cuts, rather than large sweeping ones.
In all other ways, this is a standard Mora knife."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Considering all the tools in my garage, this planer and the Dewalt 12"" sliding compound miter are the best investments I have made.  The only thing I am going to change is to put a spiral cutterhead in it.  If you have the wood bug hobby, this is THE planer to buy, short of a commercial machine.  I purchased this from Amazon on Jan 26, and it was delivered on Jan 30.  This is a good compromise of size and cutting capacity for a home or garage workshop.  I bought a dust collection adaptor to fit this to my shop vac, even though it says not to.  It fills up my shop vac pretty quickly, but it works.  I use very small increments of wood removal, and am able to get wood planed down to a perfect .500"" when measured with a dial caliper.  For fitting into 1/2"" cut dados, I couldn't be happier.  I've been using this on top of the table saw for a flat level surface, until I can make a sturdy wooden stand for it.  There are aftermarket carbide blades from Infiniti tools if you prefer not to double the value of the machine by buying a spiral cutterhead."

It cost me less thatn $350 with the installation as opposed to my neighbor who had a humidifier installed in his home for $1000.

They cook noticeably faster.  The only thing you need to be mindful of is when using for a length of time, the metal edges near the wood handle can get hot, and this is cast iron so it will stay pretty hot.  Highly recommend."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,The lithium-ion battery allows this to run a long time on a charge. There is however one flaw that hopefully B&D can address. The filter attachment can be confusing to some and the filter may become unattached at which point the motor is sucking in the dirt. A redesign where filter is attached directly to motor housing with positive and fool proof installation would solve this problem. Other than this problem a really great product.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I previously owned both a dustbuster and an electric stick vac and figured this would be the best of both worlds and it pretty much is. Basically, it's a dustbuster attached to a motorized floorbrush, so it's great to avoid having to bend down with a dustbuster. Although, you can remove the dustbuster from the stick and use it all by itself for countertops, etc.

The battery life on this unit is great! I own this model and the one without the lithium ion battery. Not only does this one (lithium ion battery) have more suction power, the battery lasts much longer and I believe it is worth paying more to get a better product.

I would not purchase this for carpets/rugs. This did not perform well on area rugs and kitchen rugs, it just doesn't have the suction power for that, so you'll still need a vacuum for those items.

The other thing I didn't love was how hair could wrap around a tiny piece of the metal motorized brush and wedge in between two pieces of plastic, requiring fine point tweezers to remove the offending hair and allow the unit to operate again. They should have put some sort of cover over that tiny piece of metal to prevent this from happening. I will be having to pull out the tweezers a lot on this!

I don't want to talk the unit down because I do love it! For picking up light dirt, debris, and hair, it does a fabulous job, without you having to bend over. Even picking up the little kibble debris from the dog, it does great, but if you're looking for maximum suction, you'll need a vacuum for that."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"When the bags arrived I thought there was a mistake! The bags looked so small! After I opened them, I still thought they were not going to fit anything!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I was pleased to order this knowing it was highly reviewed, pleased to feel the weight of the small box it came in, then very skeptical when I opened the box.

This is easy to assemble and might be confusing when you consider that it comes with 16x the amount of screws needed for any TV.  However, all you will need are the 4 nuts, 8 small allen head screws and 4 acorn nuts and you can assemble it in 5-10 minutes reusing the original screws on the back of your TV.

After quick assembly, I mounted them on my new 70"" Vizio E70 that weighs around 70 pounds and thought that the legs might not be sturdy enough.  After placing the TV on my smallish TV stand, the legs somehow feel like they transfer the weight of the TV to the bottom center and the TV feels very stable.

This is a 5 star rating because it can be a permanent solution for anyone out there that needs to mount a large TV on a small stand, it costs so little, and it feels very secure!"

When using the the stripper  I also used a full face shield and a resperator along with a long sleeve shirt and I put a bib on so that i wouldnt have paint going down my shirt. I also found that the metal disc. would sometimes clog with paint, so I would take a propane torch and burn the paint of the disc and then continue on. I did end up wearing one disc plum out and so I bought a new disc to finish up with. The stripper is a little heavy and your arms are going to get tired but my wife used it after I suspended it with 4 long bungee cords above the location she was working. The bungee cords helped suspend the tool and take the weight off the user. Anyway, the tool is very well made and plenty powerful and it beats trying to use an acid stripper. I will probably use it next to strip the paint off the cabinets in the old house and then make new doors. I can see where a home owner buying an older house could really save alot of money buying this new tool. I build high end custom furniture so i really nit pick my tools not only in there upkeep but in their performance as well and i don't keep any tool that doesnt perform. This new Porter Cable does perform very well and I feel that if your need is for a tool like this the Porter Cable stripper is the only way to go. No more messy & expensive chemical strippers."

Not sure why.  This feather is large but I wish it was straighter.  The curve makes it a bit tough to use as desired."

It's not even a strobe.  This one is still bright.  I love it.  I love the color, the light, the brightness.  It's great.  I can't wait to get the second pair.  I like that the bulb"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This is my current EDC knife and I just love it.

I have used it for many different things - it cut paper smoothly, right out of the box; I've peeled fruit & veggies with it; opened packages with it; widdled some twigs with it; cut wires; and even pried open a metal lid that was tightly seeled.

It's thumb release is wonderful and makes opening the knife quick and extremely easy. One-handed operation.

It's sturdy, looks good and has a substaintal pocket clip that holds the knife securely in place while not being difficult to remove when needed. It feels good in the hand and I've used it for about a half hour straight when peeling potatoes at one point without any fatigue.

Great item and I'm planning on getting a second as a spare (maybe for the car)."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I bought 1 of these to compare against other bulbs because it had decent reviews. This one was ok, but not as nice as the G7 Power G7GU10300WW for the same price. Please consider trying the G7 bulb and read my review of it.

UPDATE Dec-31-2013:

HitLights has sent me the updated bulb for 2014 to compare with the older bulb, and I'm pleased to say it is much improved from the old design. I'm also pleased they offered to send my a new bulb free of charge to try. Thats good customer service! First off the height of the bulb is now normal. It will not stick out of the fixture you place it in, like the old bulb did. The bulb looks exactly like what they have in the current pictures. I measured the new bulb as consuming 3.9 watts, which is more efficient than the old model (4.4 watts) and the same as my old favorite, the G7. The new bulb is a lot brighter too. I measured it at 5100 lux @ 1 foot away, compared to the old model @3860 lux. Its still not as bright as the old G7 at 7200 lux. But its acceptable. It comes on instantly and has a fairly linear dimming ability with a standard Lutron dimmer. It does have a little bit of yellow fringing at 1 foot away, but over several feet onto my dark brown granite countertop, it was mostly unnoticeable. Since the G7 is not available now, I would not hesitate to give this bulb a try. G7 however has redesigned their GU10 style bulb and it should be available soon. I always prefer products made in the USA, like the G7. I'm pretty sure this HitLights is still made in China."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"For once its nice to have a hot breakfast at work.

I almost never have time to make breakfast in the mornings so I usually take a granola bar or a piece of fruit. Now that I have this neat little set of Crackin' Egg cookers I can enjoy a hot meal at my desk and it takes less than thirty seconds. Its super easy to use. Just make sure to poke the yolk with a fork so it doesn't explode in the container. I also found that if you spray the container with a little non-stick cooking spray that the egg comes out cleaner.

The only gripe I have with these microwave egg cookers is that I haven't been able to make an egg that isn't over hard. I've tried cooking it at thirty seconds instead of the recommended thirty to fourt-five. But it still comes out over cooked. I think I'll be trying the scrambled egg recipe but other than that I still enjoy a hot and nutritious breakfast. I'm thinking this would be great for someone with kids because you could pop it in the microwave in the morning and take it with you in the car. They're very portable.

Overall I think these are a cool way to make a super fast breakfast that is nutritious as well as delicious.

All in a glue that's non-toxic and water cleanup without any fumes or even that urea smell from Elmers.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Nice and flexible.  At a reasonable price too.  I needed different size lugs than what they supply.  A quick email to the seller and I got exactly what I needed.  If you do need a different size lug, submit your change request pretty quickly because this will be shipped out before you blink."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,"Arrive yesterday and already using it. The only problem is that it's not really a hinge, but a pair of screws. I am using it with the TRS-10 and it's just a matter of removing the hinge and tightening it. If it was to break off after a few weeks, it could break the hinge and break the screw. So it's a little tricky to get it to work. I tried to do it by putting a piece of tape on the bottom of the hinge to make sure it wouldn't fall out, but it did not. I'm a little concerned about it being a good hinge, because it's only about 10 feet away from the hinge, but it's definitely a good hinge."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Love these sheets they are soft, cotton feel fit our king waterbed ."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"Light looks okay, a bit heavy for a AA size. Uses the switch to alternate between low and high. Low is too dim to be useful and the high is a WIDE Flood, not as bright as advertised.  My Fenix E21 is better on low and high is brighter at 150 lumens!  I'll stay with a Fenix E21 for an EDC light, or the Streamlight JR LED at 85 lumens.

UPDATE: April 2013, Getting ready to throw out the light, just thought I'd try something new. My new EDC lights are FENIX E11, one AA battery, 115 lumen high and 38 lumen low. Until reading some reviews, I'd have never known about 14500 batteries (AA size, just 3.7 volt, not 1.2 volt of normal AA battery.) For nearly 5 months I have been using 14500 battery in the E11, WOW! Nearly triples the light output, low is 200+ lumens, high near 300... Also, in reading, DO NOT USE TWO IN A 2 AA LIGHT!

But, there are some light manufacturers recommending a single 14500 and a dummy cell in a 2 AA light (All this depends on the LED quality, do the homework! I DID..)

In the Lightstar 300, output was only 140-150 lumens on the AA's. I've added one 14500 to one AA and VIOLA! A real tactical light!! Just over 300 lumens on high and 45-50 on low.  This is without testing equip., just comparison to other lights that are accurately measured by the makers.

Two points: 1. The warranty is voided.  and 2. Accidents may occur, use at your own risk.

Read the manfacturers LED parameters, the operating voltage is a good measure of possible use. I now have a Lightstar 300 that acts like a 300, no telling what the runtime is.  Still a one star light on AA batteries."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"Not much to say besides great buy for the money. I prefer the Aluminum most of the time, but would suggest the steel rivets for jobs needing to hold up a lot of stresses. But, you can't buy 500 rivets where I live for this price. If I ever run out, I will purchase these again.
Update:
These have been failing often for me when the rod fails to break at the rivet start... which has caused me much despair b/c I end up having to try and get the rivet to release w/out messing up my work.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Looked at the top 4 brands of these: Wagon, Koolatron, Cooluli,and Igloo. Didn't necessarily ever need warm and didn't want to wait 5 weeks for delivery so that eliminated one. Then after looking at reviews bought Coleman and Igloo to compare and a generic converter (Shumacher 6v) since it looked like they didn't come with any. (Not sure if I ordered Igloo 375 or 374 model) Purpose was for long drives in and out of hotel rooms to dog shows.  Wasn't sure if the hotels we were using had refrigerators or not.  Upon getting both Igloo hands down was better (Coleman returned)  for these reasons:
1. Cord came off the unit completely as shown in photo
2. Vertical or horizontal option w/shelf
3. Read truck driver reviews and they liked this one best
4. Shelf

Loaded cooler the day before travel to save time morning of travel. Day 1, left the house with a full cooler of frozen and cold food/drinks, got to the  hotel, plugged it in. Took what we didn't need daily and put it in hotel fridge. Done. First day at show: Forgot the adapter and left cooler in car in shade (90 degrees) and 12 hours later things were still cool inside.  Continued back and forth from show to hotel. 4 days later drove home.  No soggy food, nothing freezer or ice burned. What we didn't eat on the trip was still usable.

Awesome item. Saves time, money, food, and don't know why I never got one before! Simple.  No loading ice every day and repacking the cooler."

I like the slide switch for the setting the motor speed.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,Very bright bulbs! Nice to be able to buy them in this quantity to keep on hand for the chandeliers in my mother's house.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,Color was quite faded compared to the original.  The two saws that I got were pretty good quality and the blades are nice.  The blade is a bit larger than I expected but it's well worth the price
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Purchased as a Christmas gift.  She will love it.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,very cool. saves my lighingt time.Great quality tools. I will buy more for
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,Worked great. Exact fit to my hand and the finish is good.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,CG,"Worked great to start.  We have the wide wooden boards that came with the kit.  We use them all the time and I am happy with the results.  I would definitely recommend this product.  It is a good value.I use this as a battery replacement.  The battery is a bit smaller than I expected and it is very heavy.  I think this is the perfect size to carry around with me when I am camping.  I like that I can carry around with me when I am not camping, so I don't have to worry about pulling up to the front door or slamming it shut.  Also, the battery is very bright.  It is bright enough to see through wood and to see through glass.  It is bright enough to see through even a dimmer switch.  I have used this for a while now and I will be buying more.  I recommend this to anyone that"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Works just fine for me. I don't need to move it around and we did twist tie it into just the right position.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I saw this item on a Bobby Flay cooking show.... During commercial, I ordered it, so I can enjoy making mixed drinks..... Awesome......"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"These are very well made, and have the quality of a good smoothie.  I would recommend.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it. It is very large, and it is very comfortable to hold."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"it was great size, great quality. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the bottom on"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I love my zero water dispenser.  The filters are expensive, but I think they are worth the cost to get rid of everything!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"These extractors were VITAL for me, especially when in-store equivalents were MUCH more expensive.  I had somehow managed to snap off the bolt holding on my ignition coil on my car - which was causing me a misfire.  Luckily with amazon fast shipping and this set I was able to extract the bolt before any long drives needed to be taken.

If this had not worked, I may have been forced to drill into my cylinder head, which is never a good option, the bolt came out in under 5 minutes, half of which was reading the instructions and looking at it."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,This thing is great for keeping an electric bill down. I also love that it's removable and doesn't cost too much. I am using it in the garage to cover a lot of ground. It is great for keeping a large amount of electrical tools out of the way. Great for the price.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"I gave this product 3 stars only because I feel that it is very well made however, for me it was not a good choice because it is just too bulky to carry around. It will protect the flashlight and if you don't mind the size, it is worth the money."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,It does a good job of filtering the water but even a new filter is so slow! And you have to fill the upper container twice to get it to 2/3rds full. Don't fill it any farther or it won't filter the rest that's in the upper part. It just sits there. When you try to pour it the unfiltered water in the upper part is what comes out first. The upper container needs to be bigger. I think they made it that way so you can try their filter out and then go out and buy their filter that attaches to your faucet like I ended up doing.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,We put this in our bathroom and it is beautiful. It is well made and really adds a nice accent to our bathroom.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"This is one sturdy machine.  It is lightweight and comfortable.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because the box is a bit small, but if you are a strong person like me, this machine is a good value.I use this as a ""pumpkin grinder"" for my family's frozen pizza. I love the fact that it is a non-stick surface and does not rust! I highly recommend it!I am so happy with this product.  It's very easy to clean and the color is very vibrant.  I was surprised at how much color this has.  It is definitely a beautiful addition to my kitchen.This is a very good, thick cover for my pillow. I don't know if it would be worth the money for it, but it is a good value. It holds my pillow nicely and is a good value.Works great on my sink. I have a small sink in my living room. It has a lot of surface area and is very well made.
The only thing I wish was it a little bigger would be a little more generous for a very small area. I would have bought a couple more.This is a very nice gift.  I was looking for something to put in my fireplace.  This is perfect.  It is a little larger than I was expecting and feels very sturdy.  It is made of a very soft material.  It is a nice size for a small kitchen.  I would recommend this gift for anyone looking for something that is not a firewood stove.  I would recommend this item for any fireplace enthusiast"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Great sturdy little chair. My granddaughter loves anything moose so this has been the perfect chair for her. Love that it locks when open so no fear of collapse.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Wow!! It took a while to assemble, but it worked out great. I just put the wood in a 6 inch circle and the wood was firm and the plastic was solid. I used this to make a little decorative plates for a gift for my grandpa and he loves it. The wood is a bit rough but I think it will be fine. I am very happy with this purchase. I just wish there was a way to remove the metal from the wood rather than sliding it around on the surface of the wood. I would have liked to have a better feel for the wood.These are great, but the cotton is really bad.  I've used them for a few weeks, and I still have the cotton, but I've had no problems with them.  I'll be buying a second one for my daughter.  I have no idea how to fix this.This is the best knife I have ever owned! I use it to slice meat, fish, etc. It cuts through small cuts without the pain of slicing meat. I use it to slice garlic and onions. I use it to slice spices. I use it to cut slices of cheese and I use it for all my other recipes. I've never had a problem with it. I've only used it once, but it works perfectly. My son loves it and I love it too."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"While the price is nice, the shipping was not. Combined, I would have liked a slightly heavier duty bag. While making kefir cheese, after pouring everything into the bag, I twisted the bag to form a ball and then applied slight pressure to help expedite the draining of whey. I was surprised to see some of the curd squeeze through the weave. Perhaps it was because I did not wait until the separation had occurred and the curd had become more dense.

I was hesitant to put much pressure on the bag after that, even after it had hung for about a half hour, but it is probably a good thing as I might have been even more aggressive and ruined the bag. This is far nicer than any cheesecloth you could buy, but I suggest being gentle with it.

I am certain that depending on what this is used for, you'll get different results. For Kefir, I think it was faster leaving it in a bowl, pouring off the liquid and repeating.

At the end of the day, I am glad I have this bag and would recommend it."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Great way to recycle old throw pillows, the dog theme is cool and colorful, the price was great for a linen cover, I would recommend"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I've used this for years on my front lights to welcome us home. In the driveway an infrared type light makes sense, but on the front lights using this timer in the automated setting is best.

Installation:
I fist use a contactless voltmeter to find the Hot Wire (has 120v current)  hooked up to the light switch and mark it with nail polish. Then go turn off your circuit breaker. Next go an connect the BLACK wire to the one which you just marked with nail polish. You will need to find your neutral, which is generally white and NOT connected to a standard two pole light switch. Just find the neutral and some white 14 gauge solid white wire and create a pig tail; then connect it to the white wire with an electric wing nut. Lastly, connect the blue LOAD wire to the wire which was connected to your switch. Sometimes you might have a green wire which was a ground wire. I just loop it around the screw as I reinstall all the wires. I also tend to wrap everything in electric tape as I go to ensure no shorts anywhere.

Go to google maps and get your current location, you will need the first two numbers of your Lattitude and Longitude.  Press the big frond button for 3 seconds to enter configuration mode and follow the single directions. It's mostly updating the year, month and day, next the time and lastly the latitude and longitude. Lastly I don't like the back light on all the time, so I turn that off. It still glows for 8 seconds whenever you press any button. I use the defaul P01 which turn on at sunrise and off at 11pm in your time zone and automatically adjusts for day light savings time.

This is a very well made unit. I've noticed they've been increasing in price but purchased an Amazon Warehouse deal which was perfect, never used but just broken packaging. It saved me a few bucks and worked perfectly."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,This should be standard on all Bosch products.  I will update this review if I find any other problems.  The plastic parts are also very stiff and not easily adjustable.  The saw is well made and
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,doesn't last very long. you can only burn so long before it won't float.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I was amazed at how much it picks up! Very light worth every penny. I have all hard wood floors its perfect.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Beautiful in appearance. Very comfy to sit on and use as a guest bed. Disappointed in 1 of the arms that had several  (actually 4) cracks in the arm of the futon. Husband put it together , and didn't notice them until it was fully assembled. Too much trouble to take apart, repackage and send back."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,I have it in the garage and it does the job. The only reason I ordered this is because I had a bad run.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Wonderful mug. Keeps things hot and cold and drinks well. I will keep my tea in

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I'm changing my review from 2 to 4 because in retrospect I like it a lot but you will have to add weight to keep it from sliding around.
The reason I like it is because it's low profile and accessible from all sides."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Awesome!  With this, it is an ideal addition to my kitchen!  I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office.  The plastic lid keeps it closed and does not slip.  It does not stay in place.  This is an excellent product.  I highly recommend it.

I did not receive"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"Basically this trap is a piece of folded cardboard with a sticky patch of goo on one side. You tear open a small plastic pouch to take out a little piece of white paper which is coated in the attractant, and drop it onto the sticky patch. The moths are supposed to fly into this little triangle area the size of a small slice of pie in search of the smell, and get stuck to the one sticky side. I guess it really depends on the types of moths you have floating around your house. We have the really tiny ones that come in from outside during spring and summer in California, and this didn't catch any of them. Hopefully that means they are not the type of moths that eat clothes."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"The light is precious, but seems a little top heavy.  I'm afraid that it might fall out of the plug, so am having to return it.  Otherwise, beautiful design and captivating glow."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"although this is really nice stoneware, it is REALLY REALLY heavy
too heavy for my arthritic hands"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,THESE ARE NICE BRIGHT WHITE BULBS. THEY ARE VERY EASY TO WIRE UP AND INSTALL IN A EXISTING FLUORESCENT LIGHT FIXTURE. I WILL BE BUYING MORE OF THESE.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"For the price this is a nice piece of furniture,
Don't be a dope think you're getting Tiffany at Target prices.
It's just a lounger on the cheap.
It serves the purpose."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Fits but these lights are expensive. I think if mine blows again I'll buy a new fixture.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I love this cutting boards as they are sturdy and dishwasher safe.  They do not slip and slide around on the counter top.  Good purchase.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"This bag is built with a sturdy, wide, comfortable fit.  The bag is strong and sturdy.  The bags are also a solid construction and the plastic is sturdy.  The bags are very well made and will last a lifetime.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a bag that holds up to a heavy load.I had to order one of these to use in a different bathroom"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,CG,Pretty decent set. One of the ones I bought had a small hole in the middle. I just got a
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Perfect. It gives just enough light and is light weigh but sturdy. I actually put this on the top of a tall secretary that sits in a dark corner of my living room and it really lights up the dark spot. I am very pleased.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Do not believe the ""highlights"" - these are the roughest pillow cases I have ever had.  Plus, they are no larger than the ""regular' ones that come with sheet sets.  I bought them based on the reviews and that they were supposed to be larger and soft...they are neither.

I am a little shocked because the reviews were so good.  Do keep in mind I am highly sensitive and perhaps a ""normal"" person would think these are soft...but size...I laid them out on top of the other pillow cases I own and there is no difference at all."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"It's all been said by some of the reviewers, and I'm not sure how well this one will hold up.  The plastic parts are thin and the plastic part is a bit flimsy.  I'll be getting a better one for a few years.  I'll also be getting a stainless steel one for a few years, but I don't think I'll be buying one of those.  This one is a little bit more expensive, but it's well worth the price.  I'd definitely recommend this product.I bought these for my daughter to use for her tea.  She loves them!  She said they look great in the dishwasher.  I am very happy with them and wish they were a little smaller.They are cute. Very thin, but very nice. Love the color and the size.Love the design of this pan"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Does this really need a review? Good quality. As expected.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,CG,The Multimaster is an excellent tool. The design is comfortable and smooth. The blade is strong and the finish is top-notch.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Thank you for listing these so we can buy them one by one.  Gave a nice pleasant light for motorhome
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Dropping to 3 stars as it is not really ""non slip"", the white dots are not scratchy whatever to keep you in place, they are just deeper pieces of plastic.... Definitely not a step stool you want to use if you are actually wet, like out of the swimming pool or bathtub wet... unfortunately it took a fall for us to look at it a little closer and see they were not slip grip things.

Is still a great stool, just not safe non slip.... it is super sturdy and easy to use, just stay dry"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Excellent.  Have a disability and have had this for a few months now.  I have one broken eye
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Super easy to use and to change settings.  I'd definitely repurchase.  The water pressure is great too.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Beautiful set. Sadly, one of the bowls was broken on arrival. It would be a good thing if the inside of the box had a layer of small bubble wrap or something. Other than that I am so happy with this purchase!  Holding perfect portion sizes and is really nicely constructed too."

It doesn't lock down in the miter slot, but there is plenty of friction to keep it in place.

I've also used it with the miter slot on my router table for precise micro-adjustments."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"My first encounter with Mepra was when I bought the third set of knives for my Dad's kitchen. He loves them. The first set was a bit light and the first set was a bit heavy. I still use them for a couple of things. I like to cook and clean the knives and a lot. I did get a second set of knives at a discount for my honest review. I will update this review as soon as I get more feedback. I'm very happy with this purchase. I have used them for several years and they are well worth the money. I have a few more that I'll post about in the future. I'll be updating as needed and to make sure I've received all of the information I need for my review. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. Thank you. I have not tried this yet but I've had it for a few months and it works great. I like it, but I'm a little afraid to go ahead and buy it again because it's so easy to clean and the smell is gone. But I'll have to wait until the next one comes out to see how it does. I got this for my daughters room. It's a good size and looks good on my bed. I bought this because I wanted a mat for my son's bedroom. It is sturdy and a great value. I have had no problems with it."

I'd say this is a great product for the price.I bought this to replace the Schlage 32-60-8 bulb that I replaced with this one.  It works great, and the size is perfect.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"This is an update to my previous one star review, after several e mails I was able to receive a replacement, led lamp and power supply as per Kathy at GLW, very pleasant person.
she reassured me of the fulfillment by GLW that they would stand behind their product.
I know sometimes units fail, and you do get what you pay for, but I am happy to let every one know that GLW will stand behind their product, this uni has a one year manufacture warranty. and they are replacing the parts at no charge.
thank you Kathy, now I am a happy customer.

OLD REVIEW:
I purchased this product 4 months ago nov 24,2016 the unit worked great very impressed very bright light but the LED's are very dim about 5% and pulsing.
tried to unplug and still the same thing.
I need to know who to contact for the warranty as per GLW it has a manufacture warranty of 1 year
but I cant find who to send it to or who to contact for repairs under the 1 year warranty.
please help."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This is great crock pot carrier!! It has straps to help keep lids on you crockpot. It is insulated to help keep food warm while transporting.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,Works good.  I would clean it as soon as you get finished juicing.  I would also run the pulp through it an additional time to get all the juice out of it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"The basket is a nice heavyweight stainless steel and seems to be just what I needed. The vegetable peeler also seems to be of nice quality.
The follow - up service was good too."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I've recently moved my old C100 to the office (3 years old and no problems) and picked the Citiz for home. Overall, it's a great looking machine that simply makes amazing espresso.

Here's my quick notes and comparison with the Essenza C100:

- The red and black have subtle differences in the spout and capsule release handle. The black has a chromed handle which makes it look a bit more classier and a different spout shape which I ended up getting. The overall build quality looks a bit nicer on the Citiz than the Essenza but I've only used it for almost two months so I can't comment on reliability but no problems yet.

- The Citiz + milk has a significant larger footprint than the compact c100. However, it does integrate the frother using one plug which is a bonus.

- The folding pedastal cup holder on the Citiz is great for my larger mugs which I had to alway tilt and hold on the Essenza which was a major annoyance.

- The new Aerocinno is amazing ... a much better improvement over the older non-plus version and worth the extra money. The foam taste is a whole lot better as far as texture goes. The only thing is that it no longer uses a clever magnetic lid to keep the extra attachment.

- Overall, the Citiz amd Essenza are equally as good as the espresso taste great with both. I could recommend the Essenza for the cheaper price, in my case track proven reliability, a smaller footprint since the Aerocinno is separate and can be stored away. But for some reason, I'm just drawn to the look and ""presence"" of the Citiz. It's something that looks subtly classy in the kitchen and makes an easy process of making a cappuccino that much more enjoyable."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This product fit perfectly in the top of our ""bar-moire"".  I ordered 9 of them to span a 42 inch space.  Holds all different shapes and sizes of glasses including martini, champagne, red and white wine, etc.  Very easy to install and looks fab."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"I have had the opportunity to try the wide-mouth version of this for a couple of weeks now.  I had a similar model before and it seemed to work well.  This is a bit bigger and smaller than the wide-mouth one.  This is still a good size for me.  I have a smaller one and I can use it on my counter top.  I love the fact that it has a nice, sleek finish, and it has a very nice feel to it.  I don't know why.  I love that it has a nice feel to it and it makes it easy to clean.  It is not too big, but it is not too small either.  I love that it has a nice ""gift"" to it for it's size.  It is also very pretty."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I have bought this type of fuel for years not only for myself but for my wine and coffee cafe. I also have several different fireplace types I use it in. My customers love the ambience of the flame and best of all no flue needed. Some fuel in the past by other vendors produced soot. Probably too much oil in the mix. The fuel is not just alcohol you know. The colored flame comes from the oil/alcohol mix. The right mix gives you a great flame. This product is the best I've used in a long time. Very little cleaning of the glass on some fireplaces. And it's less expensive.

Highly recommend this product. Will be buying regularly."

We are very happy with this purchase!Great bedspread. I bought this for my 2 year old to sleep on while she's sleeping. It works great. It's very light and soft. It's not thick like some other sheets I've seen. I've had it for over a year now and it's still holding up well. I've never had it break or have it fall apart. I also like the way it's folded and the fact that it has a flat bottom so it doesn't clog up the pillows. I've had it for about a month now and it's still holding up well.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"If your desire is to use an electric drill, you may need to make a small hole in the bottom of the drill to get a solid surface to hold the drill in place. This is common in small drill bits.

I used a drill press with an adapter and a lot of pressure to hold the drill in place. I did not use the standard drill press so I could not test the impact. I tried to push the drill on the impact with a flat surface so that the impact would not get in the way. The impact does not move and it does not feel like a drill press. I am happy with the results.

I would recommend this tool.This is a great lamp.  I have used it for years and I can tell you that it's a quality lamp.  I would recommend it.This is a good product.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"After doing some research I definitely wanted a dual sensor smoke alarm which this is.  My understanding is that it is more likely to catch different types of fires like open flame vs slow smoldering.  We bought an older house that only had one alarm.  I decided that wasn't good enough in case that one ever failed we would be in trouble if we ever had a fire.  So, I got three of these to add to the house.  Installation and battery insertion is very easy.  The other question is... do they work?  Yes, they do... we were cooking in the oven and food bubbled out onto the oven elements causing smoke.  They did there job and went off.  But, once I took them outside they immediately stopped beeping.  So, they definitely work!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"UPDATE#2 The tape that is used is not what I'm used to calling VHB. Dropped my hard hat last night and two holders popped off. Do not recommend.  UPDATE: After using these for a few nights, I discovered that two of them had moved on the hard hat. I don't know if it was the freezing temps outside, or the hot temps sitting on the dash in the truck. Whatever the reason, I had to replace the tape on one of them. The tape they use it not the same VHB tape that I have. And I have 3M VHB, right out of the box, that I have used for years, so I know mine is legit.) These are not good for hard hat use. Two Cons...The holders are flat. There really is no flat spot on a hard hat, so there will be a small space along the edge that will not adhere to the surface. Its why Go Pro makes curved helmet mounts. Its a big deal, because enough of the VHB tape does make contact. Also, the holders are two different sizes. There is no instruction as to which goes where. I placed the large ones toward the back of the hard hat, and I hope that is correct."

I will update to see if any develops, but I cant imagine it happening since its so solid."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Really cute in theory. But as others mentioned no instructions came with it and it didn't fit together well in any manner I tried. As time was running out I had no option but to use it but it was very wobbly/unbalanced in the only way I could get it together, and I had to rig a way to make it stand somewhat straight by tying plastic strips tightly around the bottom stem. I don't know why the manufacturer doesn't correct these flaws numerous people have informed them of since it is a really pretty design.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This product keeps your blades & discs safe and clean when not in use.  I would not have ordered a food processor that did not have this available.  The only con is that the bottom is open - so you have to be careful if you pick up the box.  Just be aware of this and watch young would-be cooks around these kind of appliances.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Quality and quite nonstick

I bought a ""Scanpan Classic 11-Piece Deluxe Cookware Set"" in 2007, and they have been great non stick pans, serving me well for nearly a decade.

Even with a lifetime warranty, I can't expect the skillet's nonstick surface to last forever.
My SO doesn't know how to cook on low heat and we abused the heck out of them.
My fry and sautee pan from that series have lost quite a bit of their ceramic coating and were no longer non stick.

So I figured I'd invest in something that I know would last a life time.  A skillet that can't be destroyed, dishwasher safe, etc.
Enter the CSX series.

I picked up the 10.25"" fry pan, which is the perfect size for cooking bacon and eggs.

It is super great, beautiful, and has a comfortable handle.  I've had no major problems with sticking (teaching her how to cook with proper heat), and cleaning it is a breeze.
I actually use a ""The Ringer Cast Iron Cleaner XL 8x6 Inch Stainless Steel Chainmail"" to scrub clean it when needed.

It heats evenly and maintains heat (as evidenced when I pour sink water in it to steam clean it, and it boils for quite some time).

I had also bought a ""DeBuyer Mineral B Element Iron Frypan, Round"" carbon steel skillet as well, but she must have put it in the dish washer as it's all rusted now.  So I think I'll buy a second CSX fry pan.  These things will last a lifetime with no maintenance needed."

I have one toaster oven, and I like it so much I bought two sets of these toaster ovens.  I have a pizza pan and a pizza stick, and these are perfect for that.  I also like that they come with a small hook that you can use to attach to the bottom of the pan.  I like that the cooking time of the oven is very quick, and it's so easy to clean.  The cooking time of the oven is a little shorter than other ovens I've used, but it's a great product. "

I like the size of the top, but I like the size of the bottom.  It's very easy to store, and I don't want to mess up the counter top.  I also like the fact that it has a little lid.  I do like that it doesn't have a screw lid on the bottom, but it's a bit of a hassle to get to the bottom if you want to store it.  I don't have to worry about the metal going up.  I also like that the lid is not too big.  I also like the fact that the bottom has a plastic lid on the top.  The lid is about the size of a large cookie sheet, and it's very easy to store.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,I decided to tile my house and used a tile saw that has seen a fair amount of usage and it was time for a new blade as the old one was chipping the glazed porcelain tile really bad. I noticed this blade was much larger than the old one but I can only assume that is due to the amount of wear on the old one. This worked well for about 40 cuts then started chipping the tiles also. I ended out buying a much better blade and it hasn't chipped a single one yet. I guess I should know you get what you pay for.

I have not had a chance to test it against my other scale, and it seems to be working very well.  I would recommend this scale for any kitchen or"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I have used this for a few weeks and am very pleased with it.  First, it makes a good cup of coffee, even without factoring in the convenience.  I'm still trying different varieties.  The French Roast is so far my favorite.  By dialing in either 6, 7.5, or 9 oz, it is very easy to adjust the strength to your tastes.  I find even the 9 oz to be strong enough.

The build is very sturdy, better than most of the other pod coffee makers.  Charcoal filter in the water is a good idea for those living in the city.

Only disadvantages I see are that the machine is relatively expensive, it costs more per cup, of course, than a regular coffee maker, and your choices of coffees are more limited.  But if you only want one cup in the morning on the way out the door, it's certainly quick, with no mess, and leaves no wasted, leftover coffee.  I find it of good value."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I love this shower head and my husband does too.  It is my second one.  We bought one for the master and liked how it looked and how it feels.  It feels like gentle rain and after many months I still enjoy my shower every day.  True it doesn't have massage functions but I don't miss that.

The only thing I wish was that I ordered the extra long hose.  In winter I wash the kitty litter box in the bathroom instead of outside and it reaches somewhat while it's sitting on the floor but not long enough.  Not a consideration unless you would be doing the same thing.

Remember!!  Must buy the hose and connector.  Yes, I know it's pricey but it's worth it!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,These are well made and reasonably priced.  I will be buying more.  I washed themand they came out of the dryerin great shape.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This doorbell easily installed on my chain link gate with the included sticky pad.  I placed the ringer on a plastic board and fastened the board against the fence.  Most of the rings are digital music.  There are eight ""ring"" options on this doorbell which was sufficient for our needs.  The second loudest setting can be heard down the hallway through a closed door.

Waterproofing is as advertised. I frequently water my bushes with the gate open, and the ringer gets drenched.  It's also held up well in the southern California sun, with the battery lasting over 8 months already.  You will have to unscrew the circuit board to get to the battery, which is going to be a pain when the battery needs replacement.
Pay a little more to get the SadoTech. The cheaper models don't last."

Very thin footprint with a slight increase where the lights and probably the batteries are. Extremely bright. The on button can be a little tricky to engage though-maybe R&D can place a few small dots around the switch.

Nice size, extremely thin. Supposedly the batteries last quite a long time. Nice finish, and if you're on the side of the road after your car took a crap you can do a few SOS flashes.

I don't know about the earlier reviews, maybe problems have been fixed since 2007-2008, but for $125 I have found this drill to be very powerful and sturdy, the chuck has never slipped and the batteries are not only powerful but last a long time and charge super fast.

You can use it to cut breads without flattening or mashing the bread or to cut delicate fruits and vegetables like tomatoes.  A serrated knife is a must have in the kitchen!

This knife from Cestari Kitchen is 6 inches long and comes with a cover for the blade.  I love this about this knife because we have another serrated knife without a cover and have cut ourselves on it many times just reaching in the drawer.  The cover slides on and off easily but stays on when not in use.  The knife blade is ceramic making it very different than any of our other knives.  A ceramic blade will not rust so I do not have to worry about leaving it in water.  A ceramic blade is also harder than a stainless steel blade which means that this knife will last longer.

I have used this knife on a variety of foods in our kitchen.  I really like using it on bread because with the serrated blade, it will cut through the bread and make a clean, straight cut.  I get more precise slices of bread with this knife.  I also use it when making salads and can cut anything from the hardest carrots to the softest tomatoes.  Since I can cut so many different things, it means that I can cut everything I need to cut with one knife.  This knife is very sharp so I do not recommend letting children use the knife.  I keep the cover on the knife anytime it is not in use for safety as well.

This knife has been a great addition to my kitchen.  Many of our utensils are older and we are slowly replacing them.  This knife has already gotten a lot of use!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I have two of these.  As a long-time composter, this canister is really great.  You definitely need the charcoal filters to keep odor at bay (unless you empty it every day, which I dont) but the stainless steel is tough and cleans completely with little effort.  I have banged this around, kicked the lid across the floor (accidentally) and dropped it full, onto my stone floor from counter height and the worst I got was a minor dent.  I have banged it hard on the composter, in effort to dislodge stuck-on stuff and the edge still looks perfect.  FOr all the abuse I put this thing through, I couldn't have made a better choice.  Yes I highly recommend it.  Order extra filters."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Always good to have an extra charged battery on hand when needed so as to enable you to finish a task. Just a little expensive.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I love good coffee and do not mind spending a little money to research different coffee making products. This does indeed brew some good coffee. Importantly, this device will keep that coffee fresh tasting for the two hours that I have it on the 'warm' setting. It is easy to fill and set up. It took me a few minutes to figure this thing out. I was used to the carafe brewers. Pros:
-On the 'bold' setting, it makes a good tasting brew. It keeps the coffee good tasting on the 'keep warm' function. -Easy fill, no spill. For filling the container or filling a cup. Cons:
-If you fill the internal water container over the 'marked' 12 cup line, the water will leak out a hole in the back. The next morning you may wonder why there is some water under the coffee maker. I did this a few times before I figured it out. Duh-ho! It looks like there is a lot more room in the container for the extra water, not so, too much water will drip out the back (unseen). -The bottom of the container is hard to clean, 8 plastic screw anchors, for the 'keep warm' plate, are on the bottom of the container. I like to use a soapy sponge to clean after use, the little things sticking out of the bottom make that harder than it should be. Overall: This is a good buy. I would not recommend it to a friend, unless, I first explained 'cleaning thing' mentioned above. If you love good tasting coffee, hey, buy it."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I purchased 5 of these trays total (2 - 1/4"", 2 - 3/8"", 1 - 1/2"") and was able to condense 2 drawers down to one drawer.  And I was able to add an additional socket set that i kept in it's own case.  I have broken a couple of the clip/adapters as they are plastic.  It helps if they are spaced apart and when attaching or removing a socket that you do not apply side to side pressure.  You can purchase additional clips but you shouldn't really have to worry about being so easy on a garage tool type item.  Also attaching some of them especially smaller sizes they do not want to do the full locking turn as most do.  Not always an issues and they will typically attache enough where they are not loose.

I used to have those bottomless trays you lay in the drawers and your sockets fit in the holes.  Your sockets were not mobile like they are with these trays and  There was A LOT of wasted space."

Are you listening P3?  It would also be nice to have a 15A/20A version for measuring microwave ovens, dishwashers and such.  Put a 20A receptacle on the front. When using with a 20A outlet, just rotate the blade sideways on the back and plug it in.

I wish someone would make a headless Bluetooth Kill-A-Watt that you could read with a smartphone app.  Unfortunately, it would need an Apple MFi certification to work with iPhone's Bluetooth and therefore drive up the cost by $20.  Even better, make it work like the Chromecast stick, Roku stick or Amazon's Fire TV stick and run it on the home's Wi-Fi network.  They have an idiot proof technique to join these devices to the network.  You completely avoid the MFi Bluetooth certification expense and can sell folks a phone or tablet based management app that monitors their Kill-A-Watts around the house.  Let's see, one to track the refrigerator, one for the entertainment center, a 220v one that is on the A/C circuit, one for the clothes dryer, a hardwired one for the kitchen oven and one on the furnace.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Nice and simple pot. Has six hour timer, however, would like to have a longer delay for the day use. Also, when using the timer, it always resets the final temperature to 190 degree. Would be nice if it can ""remember"" the previous temperature setting. The inner container is coated with floury charcoal, not teflon coating that any other brands offer. It claims to bring out the fine taste of water. To me, at least it looks better than the grey teflon coating. Another feature missing is it does not come with the audible alarm.

Extra spec that I would like to know before ordering:
Power: 700 Watt
Temp setting: 140, 180, 190, 208
No audible alarm for any events.

I have received this as a gift and as a corporate tchotchke as well as having bought one and they do come in handy.  The problem is that it runs through batteries pretty quickly if you use this for anything more than looking for your keys on the ground or the deadbolt on your door when you forgot to leave on the porch light.  The lens cap tends to turn itself on in your pocket or bag... draining away the power.  I haven't ever used it as a keychain device as I don't like a lot of bulk.

I haven't ever experienced the reported problem with the end cap loosening.  The best task I've found for this light is to hang it on the keyring holder in my laptop bag.  It's simply not well suited to a pocket or to a keychain, and I believe that was its intended purpose.

I found the light, itself, to be fairly bright at full power, but with a more robust LED, it would probably be a better unit.  It does have a better light distance than an LED would produce, though.  All-in-all, a bit of a miss, but I'm a flashlight hound, so I still like it.  If you are looking for a good keyring light, get a smaller LED with an on/off switch.  This would probably make a good light for a purse or in a glove compartment.  I would recommend pairing it with a Lithium Battery (Technuity L92BP4 Battery, Lithium Aaa Photo Battery for example) - especially if storing in car or bag for long periods.  Make sure you tighten the lenscap well so it doesn't accidentally turn on."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I was a bit nervous about it, but it worked out great.

The only downside is that it's very small"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,They flicker and do not dim fully. These are cool white-nowhere near warm white. As expected the cool white stayed the same color when dimmed. The whole reason for dimmable lights is to create a more romantic atmosphere. Think candle light. The light must become redder than warm white. So we replaced the bulb with a tungsten bulb.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Great deal for the price. These provide lots of light and the fixture looks and feels like a high quality product.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Idea of having a collapsible rack wasn't why I purchased it but I have found this useful.  Nice and deep and can store plenty on it so really because it is deep it takes up less space than other racks.  Very sturdy and even with a lot of heavy items on it it was very easy to move.  Highly recommend.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,Love the print and color of these rugs but they are very very thin. Great accent pieces but the runner is an unusual size and the small area rug is very small.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,We used it for a party.  After the party we put the sever in the refrigerator and used it a few days later for another party. I washed the unit by hand and washed the storage cups in the refrigerator. At first we kept the condiments cool with ice cubes and then used small ice packs.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,The roses are beautiful. I am using them as flower pot pens in a black vase.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a great product! It is the perfect size for me to put in some carrots and some ranch dressing for a late afternoon snack. The included ice pack is a little difficult to remove the first few times, but it's only a minor inconvenience. All in all, I love this little container. Some mornings I will even take oatmeal in it instead for breakfast when I get to work - it's the perfect size! I would definitely recommend to all."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Just ok.  It takes a lot of cutting to really chop a salad and it has a tendency to bruise spinach.  I suspect the double  mezzalunas would do a better job of chopping, however, I read that the food would get stuck in between the blades and I could see that.  You would need to have blades that were spread further apart than I could find to solves that problem.  I read complaints on the cover however, I have no problem with the cover.  I haven't attempted to sharpen it yet so I'm a little concerned about that.  However, it still beats hand chopping so I still recommend it if you like to chop your veggies for a sald."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I have been inthe process of removing a transmission from a 93f150.
I put this tool to the test when I was removing 4 bolts to remove the rear driveshaft.
I will tell you make sure you use quality wrenches when using this tool. It should seem obvious. But, bottom shelf HF wrenches will bend. Make sure to have minimum craftsman raised panel wrenches or better.

But anyways, if your getting sick of hurtin your hand trying to bust nuts with a 1/2 or a 12 mm. This is the tool for you."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,This is by far the best hose I have ever used and owned
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I am a writer, and the room where I work is always colder in winter than the rest of the house. I got tired of wrapping myself up like a Christmas present in order to keep warm while working. Heat Storm to the rescue!

Pros:
Wide stance and very stable - will not be knocked over if bumped accidentally.
LIghtweight, large handle on top - can be easily picked up and moved
Fan is relatively quiet, and not annoying
Has a high-power and low-power setting, so energy usage can be controlled (changes fan speed from high to low)
Comes pre-set at 70F, but the settings can be easily adjusted
Does not have a ""hot smell"" odor when in use (at least so far)
Best of all, it does indeed heat a fairly large room quickly and efficiently.  The manufacturer says it will heat up to 1000 square feet.  My room is larger than that, and it heats the area just fine.

Update:  The more I use this heater, the more I like it. Infrared heat is the same kind of heat we get from the sun. Instead of trying to heat the whole room, I now place the heater about six feet away from my work area, point it in the direction of my chair, and run it on the low power setting. The result is a gentle heat, much like sitting in a pool of sunshine on a beautiful spring day. Lovely.

Description of how an infrared heater works, from a commercial heater company (biosmart solutions):
""An infrared heater operates differently from a conventional space heater in that the infrared heat waves heat the body and objects of the room directly. The heat stays evenly distributed and the room retains the heat longer. In contrast, conventional heaters heat by first raising the temperature of the air within the room, which in turn heats you.""

Cons:
None so far

I have only had this heater for a short time, so its long-term durability is still unknown.  Very happy with this product so far!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Impressed!! Ordered from Amazon Prime, showed up right on time and packaged well.... I'm a plumber by trade, I don't deal much with this sort of thing however I know quality when I see it. This unit is built well, very easy to assemble and set up. My existing confidante drain was routed through my crawl space about 30' gravity drain through a foundation vent draining right up against the foundation. Summer heat made for LOTS of water pooling. The hornets and bugs loved the fresh water! I have a utility sink right next to my a/c coil in the garage. I set this unit up right under the a/c coil drain pan, 3/4"" PVC pipe into pump container and routed the 3/8"" tube into mop sink. Plugged it in, poured water in from a cup to test. It fired right up and continued to work perfect. It's very quite and it comes with the check valve so water in the tube vertical doesn't drain back into the resivoir. Very happy with it!"

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.I've used this product several times and it's still working great.  I don't know if it's the heating element or the water or the foam insulation, but I have to keep in mind that I haven't washed it yet.  It washes well and I have no problem with it.  I use it to hang a sheet of fabric and it is good for covering my sleeping area.  I love that it has a zipper to keep it secure.  I'm very happy with the purchase.This is the only one I have that isn't a magnet, but if you are looking for a magnet, you will find it here.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This flashlight is incredible. I had to purchase 15 of these guys for a full wall to wall inventory count at the warehouse. I would expect to pay 2 or 3 times the cost in order to get the same quality and brightness. The warehouse guys are none to destroy anything as accidents happen. We were using the large Maglites but, those were heavy and hard to manage with a clip board. These guys are bright, small, and durable. We had someone drop one from 30 feet and it worked just fine afterwards.

Quality, Shipping, and Price are all there.

I would by again and have purchased one for my own personal use."

So far there is a big difference now when I lay down to get some rest. The pests ( mites, or other pests) are not bothering me. I also treated my box spring with small amounts of pesticide to add additional protection.

They are a little brighter than the fluorescent lights but still bright enough to see if you're in the hallway.

Update 2:  I bought another one for the master bedroom.  I'm not sure how long it will last but it's nice to have more light at night.  I can't say how long it will last but I'm hoping it"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Want to know the bane of an electric car?  I will say that it's a pretty good electric car.  The motor is solid and takes the guesswork out of how much power it needs.  It does a good job of pulling the fuel out of the car and does a great job of avoiding the nasty gas smells that can occur in the car.  It also has a nice height knob that adjusts the height of the car.  I like that the car has a motor that is adjustable from about 1,000 to about 1,000 watts.  That is a big plus.  I am happy with the car because it has a nice weight to it.  The only downside I have is that I don't like the ""gift"" feature.  I wanted something that would be easier to use and I thought the gift feature was a good feature.  I gave it to my friend and she loved it.  It is very cute and I really like that it has a drawstring that can be used to hang it on the wall.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a very strong, compact"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"When you are trying to find an outlet with a bulb, it's important to know what type of light you have. The LED bulb is very bright, and the bulb is very large.

The bulb is in a large, multi-function light fixture with two large LED outlets.  The bulb is very bright, and it is very large.  It is so bright that it is very bright, and it is very bright that it is very long.

The bulb is about 30 years old, and the light is very dim, which is why I put it in a dimmer.  It is so dim that it is not in use.  It is not bright enough for normal use, and I don't think it would be practical to keep it in a dimmer.

The light fixture is very small, so I wouldn't expect it to be too small, but it is not too small.  I would say that the light fixture is very small, and that it is not too bright.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Tough and durable. Be sure to look yours over and make sure the enamel isn't chipped or doesn't completely cover everything. Im so happy I purchased this item. It's really heavy but cooks so well and is durable. I would recommend hand washing and only using wood utensils. It takes time to heat up and or cool down. If you overshoot your desired temp it will take time to cool down and this retains heat well. Would definitely purchase again.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"So I like big desks with lots of spots to organize your things on. My wife hated my previous desk, which was big with lots of organizing space. She thought it was ugly, but it was the only desk I could find that suited my needs in that exact way. Then I found a desk set that wowed both me and my wife. This credenza made a great extension of that desk set.

It's a simple design, but that belies the great functional details and style this desk offers you. The desk top is a good size with a nice slick finish that will make the room you have it in look better just by being there. The desk has some heft to it, but not so much where you cannot move it around. On top of the desk is a central opening with a cover for cables to come through. Under the desk is a nice cable management system going all across the center of the back board that ends next to holes in the side boards for you to run cable without hitting the ground. All in all a nice way to organize your cords.

The desk is not made of solid wood. If it were I would be worried as good solid wood furniture doesn't come cheap. What you do have is a nice, thick, layered particle board desk that is a good deal sturdier than what you normally find. Installation is pretty easy, but it is tedious if you don't have power tools. A Philips head screwdriver and maybe a hammer is all you need.

This credenza was used as an extension for a larger desk set I put together. You can do the same as this particular collection is very customizable. As a basic desk all on its own it makes for a good, solid worktable. I would recommend a hutch from the same collection to get the most out of it."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"I just finished installing this timer so can't comment on longevity yet. All my house fans are on timers but my previous Levitron timers are breaking after about 5 years. I'm hoping this Woods brand lasts longer.

As other reviewers have noted if you install according to instructions you end up with a gap between the switch cover plate and the timer. Perhaps there's no true standard but this Woods timer was off by a 1/4 inch!  I added washers to prop the timer out from the wall (trial and error) and got it flush. Thinking I was done I screwed in the switch plate only to discover the plate itself now wouldn't sit flush on the wall (because now the timer post was out from the wall. I thought I'd have to ""pick my gap"" so to speak.

I went to the extreme and ended up hack sawing the face cover plate screws in half (tricky). Now the timer and the switch plate fit snug with no gaps.

Way, way, too much futzing around to justify 4 or 5 stars from me. I can't help but think this timer has a design flaw."

I'm suffering from a minor sciatica pain and I had hoped that a chair like this that would relieve lymphatic vessels around hips would help.  But this one did not.  I couldn't find a comfortable position.  After only using it for a few hours, my shins were slightly bruised! (Purple veins were apparent)  I tried not to put too much weight on the knees/shins, but then my pelvic bones were in pain like I was on a bicycle for hours.  So I would put my weight back on my knees/shins, but then I would have pain in my shin - not so much in the knees.  I decided I couldn't work like this for 8-10 hours a day, 5 days a week.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"I received my  Black & Decker Allure Iron  and quickly discovered signs that it had been returned.  The cord was not neatly wrapped. The tab on the box was open. There were fingerprints on it. I plugged it in  and found that it would only heat to about 130. Then a thin line of smoke came up from the iron. I returned it and Amazon promptly sent me a new one. With the wonderful reviews I've seen here I was confident that the this one would work beautifully!  Sadly this one wouldn't get hot enough either!  It put out a good amount of steam but only heated again to about 130. I tried ironing a cotton garment  and it just wouldn't get all of the wrinkles out! Let me assure you, I followed the instructions in the manual to the letter! The second one went back too. I got a quick refund. Despite the great reviews I just wasn't ready to try my luck on a third! Very disappointing!
Update: I very much appreciated Spectrum Customer Service reaching out to me. I contacted them and they sent me a new iron. Sadly this iron performs about the same as the others. I checked the temperature of the soleplate when set on ""linen"". The temperature was in the 130s in some areas, high 120s in others. My research shows that an the temp should be about 235 on linen, 204 on cotton. 135 is good for nylon, acrylic , spandex. This iron puts out good steam and will get mild wrinkles out of cotton (when set on linen) but won't remove a crease. It won't get linen completely smooth. This is 3 out of 3 Allure irons that won't get hot enough. I would encourage other reviewers to check their irons with an infrared thermometer and see what readings you get, especially if you purchased yours in the last few months."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This is an easy-to-install temporary screen door. It goes up quickly -- but you have to have a wooden frame to attach the tacks included. The seal is made with a combinationof tacks, velcro and magnets. (It sounds more complicated than it is.)

It goes up easily and is the size of a standard outer door. I was unable to use this with my sliding door (because of the tacks), but it works well over a standard door frame and has been effective in keeping bugs out. Pets would be able to get out though."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I recently got this HTC Portamate PM1000 mobile base and a Delta 50-345.  The HTC comes with everything you need to assemble the base, while you have to provide your own hardwood for the Delta.  The HTC is adjustable to the nearest inch, making it a bit looser fit than the Delta (so, you still need some wood to shim your machine tight, or attach your tool to the stand).  I think the Delta would be harder to assemble if you didn't already have a drill press or some similar means of drilling a perfectly squared hole.  The rolling action of both is pretty comparable.  Overall, I'd probably choose this HTC over the Delta if I needed a third mobile base."

This one is a little bigger than my previous one and a little bigger than my previous one.  I don't know why.  I'll try to keep this one in the shop and keep it handy.I like the design of this blade.  I have to get the threads in the right positions and to make the ""top"" thread to the blade a bit longer.  I was able to cut down the threads from my saw with this blade.  I also had to figure out how to use the blade to cut my file.  I was able to cut a 5"" of paper with this blade.  I was able to cut a 4"" of paper with this blade.  I was able to cut a 4"" of paper with this blade.  I also had to figure out how to use the blade to cut my file.  I am now happy with this blade.

The color is nice and deep. It is a good size for a size 9. I use it for tea and also for a gift. I love the color and the size. I am very happy with this mug. I just wish it came with a little more storage on top. I bought this for a friend who uses to bake cookies for her kids. She loves it, and it is a great size. I ordered these after reading some of the reviews and was surprised at how well they worked. They do work well for my purposes, but the ""raw"" baking is too thin to bake for my family. I wish they were the ones that made the muffins more flaky. I gave them a 4 because I was concerned that they might get a little too thick. I am not sure how long they will last, but I'm sure they will last for a long time. I have not used them yet, but will be putting them in a couple of weeks. They are perfect for my needs, but if they are not made well, I will make them anyway. Very nice quality."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I was an electrician/electrical contractor for 25 years. I was not some fly-by-night residential sleazoid either. I ran multi-million dollar jobs and did both commercial and industrial trouble-shooting. I state without fear of contradiction, by my peers, that this tool is IT. This is the best hacksaw ever made unless perhaps it is the OTHER Lennox high tension hacksaw frame. If you like your fingers buy a 32 tooth blade. (I always favored the Lennox blades as well)

Why is this so good? The frame is made of strong aluminium alloy with a hollow steel top bar in which the blades are stored. The tensioning device is not a wingnut for fingers,or a screw for a tool, but a crank that folds up and out of the way. The balance is not quite as good as the old Kleins, but those are long gone and were not not nearly so convenient; (screw tensioner, round top bar that eventually bends. losing tension) When I bought my first Lennox for some $60 bucks I shouted ""Hossana!"". The tooth size is measured in number of teeth per inch. Evil contractors buying 24 tooth blades to speed production when I was an apprentice,accounts for why I have a permanent groove and partial feeling in my left thumb. Why? Because they do not cut smoothly and tend to hop out of the cut and onto you. Buy the 32 tooth blades as they do not have such a tendency to jump out of the cut.

The only weakness in this design is the spare blade keeper. It is or was a threaded screw tightened by hand. To improve this I drilled and threaded the hole to a 1/4""X20 hole with a 1/2"" 1/4-20 screw in the hole for better function. If the hole is far enough forward it will go entirely through the frame, and thread on the frame rather than the steel top bar. This is a piddling concern. This is the best hacksaw made."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I purchased both the 10 inch queen and the 12 inch King mattresses. I am extremely impressed with both mattresses They were delivered on time and very nicely packed in a right sized box. The mattresses puffed up to full size in about 45 minutes with no odor. They feel magnificent, just the right amount of softness with solid support. We purchased the 10 inch queen for the guest room and after trying it out we immediately replaced our king with the 12 inch DreamFoam, it was that good. DreamFoam bedding has my highest recommendation. I really couldn't be more satisfied. Our previous mattress cost three times as much and wasn't nearly as comfortable. Buy this mattress, you won't regret it. Also, thank you for making good on the three day delivery right to my front door. I know this review sounds too good to be true.

It's very easy to use and the quick release action makes it much easier to use.  This drill is super fast and easy to use.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"As some of the other reviewers has stated, this is definitely a version 1.0 product.  I'm on an Android phone and the app is missing the ability to view the camera remotely. You can't simply use the Skybell app to see if everything is OK at the door.  The motion detection doesn't work, and you have to press the door bell before it'll send you an alert.  This was supposed to be working when they shipped.  I emailed them directly to check before ordering.

The Android app is crashing when you try to configure some things.  Android tablets are not all supported so you can't use all your mobile devices inside your home to view the Skybell activity. I have an Acer and the app will not install on the device. This is limiting as you always have to have your phone near you.  Hope they fix this soon.

I had my WiFi access point configured for N-Only as I do not have older 802.11b/g devices.  It never connected to the 2.4Ghz N-Only radio.  I had to go back into the WiFi AP and reconfigure to support the older 802.11b/g devices.  It says it's N compatible, but looks like it may not be.  This delayed the install procedure as I tried 5 times to get the device connected to the WiFi before taking a look at the WiFi AP settings.  So if you're having problems connecting it to your WiFi, double check this setting.

I think the concept is a really great idea and hopefully these items are simply version 1.0 growing pains.  Wait a few months for the product to mature.  If they can get the rest of the features in and fix the app bugs, it'll be a cool product."

The bowl that comes with it is a nice size and we have not needed a larger one yet. Also, maybe you have noticed this but many of the recipes I have been trying from Pinterest and other sites have the ingredients in ounces or grams instead of cups and teaspoons.

I did purchase some accessories from Amazon but haven't tried them yet so I cant review them yet.  So far I totally love this."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Ordered these for our pumpkin party.  We put them in the pumpkins after the kids carved them.  Worked great!!! The price was good too!  Will be looking g for these again next year!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"The overall size and capacity of this suction cup is good enough to make a small vacuum cup. I had a similar vacuum cup that was provided by a company called 4-Way. They had no issues with the suction cup. I would recommend this suction cup for the price. I love these towels!  They are very soft and absorbent. I also use them to wash my nails and they do not stain. I have a hard time cleaning them because they have a rough texture. I have a hard time with drying them, but I do use them daily. They are great for my hands, but I can't say how much they do. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. This is a great pillow for a few bucks or more. It is sturdy, but very comfortable for a bed. It does not look like it was made out of plastic. It is a nice looking pillow, but not for a single person. I love this crockpot!  It is easy to clean, it is easy to use, and it is easy to clean!  I would recommend it to anyone!I have a cup of coffee every morning and this was perfect!  It made my morning coffee perfect!  I bought a second one for my son and it is a perfect size for his lunch!  It comes with a nice cover and a handy timer. It is sturdy and easy to clean. I do recommend this coffee maker for the price!I purchased this for my daughter's room. It works great and keeps her hands warm for hours. The little ones love it!I love this pan."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"Attractive simple wall clock, runs time on the wall and is easy to read. I have one in my bathroom and the other in a closet. The clock is a great addition to my bathroom. It is attractive and I am very pleased. I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago."

The only reason I gave"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"At first glance I thought this will never last.  However, it's holding up well and the price was great."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,Don't really hate it. Would give it 3 stars I just read the worst reviews first because of the flaws. If I had longer wrenches this would be ideal. 14 pockets but the wrenches sink in the pockets. Material seems very sturdy to give it a long lasting feeling. Corner edge is to long for regular 17 inch deep tool box but the extra space just folds up. The 5782 was a way better fit for everything.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Only thing I don't like is the suction on the bottom of the cup. I have one in my bathroom and the other in a closet. The suction is not great and it's difficult to get it to be fixed in a matter of seconds. This is a problem for me.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Just as described, worked great. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Well-made level.  I don't know where it was manufactured, but it seems sturdily built.  Price line is good.  I gave it to my son for part of his birthday gift.  I'd buy another. . . and probably will. . ."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"The Dreamaway Comfort Fill Mattress Protector was good for a while but then problems arose.  First was that the fill compressed in the center, which created a shallow dip in the center.  Next the top material pilled too much; some pilling was expected but this became too excessive."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,"I ordered this LED as a replacement for the one in the saw.  The yellow LED has a very strong yellow tint and the bright white LED is the lightest in the saw.  I have had no issues with the saw.  I have had no issues with the blade.  I have used it with a saw and it is very smooth and smooth.  It has also been very easy to install.  I used it to hold a cutt down fence in a wooded area to cut into wood.  The saw will cut out a 2-4"" strip of wood and then it will put it back together and hold it in place.  It is a very durable tool.  The saw does a good job of holding and holding the strip in place.  It has a very smooth cut and the saw is very sharp.  I would recommend this saw for anyone.I really like these. They are great for taking a shower. They are very bright and they are very small. They fit my shower head perfectly. I use them for a wide variety of tasks. I have used them for very small jobs, I have had them for a long time and they are very handy. They are a good size for small jobs"

Well I was so satisfied with the 1.28 gallon flusher that I had plenty of confidence going into the 1 gallon flusher.  It is very effective and handles ""all of the Yule logs that I throw down the chimney"" if you know what I mean.  I'll be buying another for sure"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I bought this vacuum primarily for use on my laminate floors, and it works very well. I'm very pleased with the suction, especially given the price.
The tools are... okay. Actually, I LOVE the crevice tool. However, I found the dusting tool effective only for moving cat fur around without sucking it up. The upholstery tool worked okay, but when I took the removable piece off to empty dust out, it seemed impossible to put together again without breaking the plastic parts. I managed to pop it back into place, but then it wouldn't spin. Just too much of a pain; I ended up attempting tools from a previous vac.
Oh yes, and the retractable cord does not work on my vac. That is a bummer; but overall I still like the product."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"Worked great for about 2 days, and now it won't keep the signal. It stays on maybe 10 minutes a day, and has been the biggest waste of money I've had in a long time.

The notifications stopped working completely, and so did the motion alerts. Don't waste your money."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,CG,"Recently bought a few of these. The only problem is that they are not very bright.  They do not have the dimmable feature.  The light output is not great, but that is not a problem.  The size is good.  I like the way the light comes on and off.  I also like the fact that the light is on by itself.  I will probably just buy more of these.  I am not sure what I will buy more of these.  I have no complaints.I bought this as a replacement for my old version"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,So these batteries have been around for a long time. I have used them for about a year now
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"I juice a lot of ice.  It's a good idea to make a small amount of ice a day.  The ice will hold up well if you're not careful.  The only thing I wish was a bit more precise was to make the ice stick to the top of the mug.  I have a glass of orange juice and I have a mug that is about the size of my mug.  I like the idea that you can cut it down to a few ounces, but if you don't want to make ice, I would suggest cutting it down to just a few ounces.  I like that the ice doesn't stick to the top of the mug.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Streamlight quality and very bright small light. Programming the different modes was quick and easy, though switching from low to bright take some getting use to. Not sure how long the batteries will last but I have an endless supply of them at work"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Ok, I received this blade about a week ago and decided to replace the 60T stock blade on my Kapex for a large built in job.  This required me to cross cut a LOT of 3/4 and 1/4 oak plywood.  This stuff can be made a mess pretty easily with a crappy blade.  The 80T did a wonderful job on the ply and solid materials.  Almost no tear out/splintering on the ply and the cuts on the solid stock where beautiful.  This blade cuts as well as my $150 Tenyru.  Time will tell how well/long it stays sharp.  Will post more info in a few weeks.

UPDATE.....been using the blade for a couple of weeks.  Still sharp.  The thing that sets this blade apart, and all good blades, is the ability to cut small amounts from small mouldings and leave them laying on the table rather than sending them off like a missle.  This blade has not thrown anything yet!  Will be purchasing another one as a back up."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,"The light could be brighter, but it's not very bright.

The light is bright enough to light up the floor and the room."

I have a friend who has a broken one, so I was a little skeptical of this purchase. I did not realize that this would work well, but I thought it would be nice to have an option for a replacement.

I had a lot of trouble with the ring and the cover was very flimsy. The gloves are very comfortable and I'm very pleased with the quality of the product. The only thing I'd change is to order the 3-pack of the gloves to add to my collection. I just bought the new gloves and they are very nice and I like that they're not cheap. I highly recommend these gloves. I would definitely recommend these gloves to any friend or family member.These are great, but the button is a bit hard to push on. I'm not a big fan of the button, and I'm not sure if it's because the button is not supposed to be on, or if it's the button that is hard to push. I will update this review when I receive them.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,CG,"I purchased this at a discount on Amazon. com. I will update this review if I find a cheaper price. The plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large. The bulb is not in the same position as the rest of the bulbs. The light is not a very bright white, and it has a very low output (just a single beam). I was hoping that the bulb would be brighter, but it is not. The bulb is not very bright, but I have no doubt that it will last for years, and is still a great value. It is a great value for a good price. This is a very good lamp. I like the fact that it does not have a ""lock"" which means that it can be turned off with the ""lock"" button. I have no idea how to turn it off without this lock, but it does not have the lock button as it is in the picture. I bought a new set and this is the only one I have. I use it to go to the bathroom when I am away from the house. It is a nice lamp that does not turn on when it is dark. It is not the best lamp I have ever owned, but it is perfect. I will buy more of this lamp in the future. This is a good product. I am very happy with the quality of the product. I use it for reading in a dimmer. I have purchased two more for my son's room, one for a bedroom and one for a bathroom. The one that I use is a standard, incandescent light."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Quality hardware, and the quarter-turn valve works smoothly. One note of caution: this screws right into most faucets, but not all. If it doesn't fit, you need to buy a separate adapter for a few bucks. We actually changed faucets from a Kohler Alteo to a Dawn AB77 so this faucet diverter would work without an adapter.

The diverter's aerator works as well as the faucet's original aerator. And there are no leaks.

We got this diverter so we could use it to fill tropical fish aquariums BTW--not the use most people would make of it to be sure, but very handy if that's what you need.

Note that it looks good enough so that we just leave it on the faucet. If you're going to do this, though, you'll probably need a ""high arc"" faucet--otherwise the spout's too low."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"As some other reviewers have said, save your money and get just the basic version.  I can see that if you were doing many many drawers of exactly the same size that the deluxe version would come in handy.  But for just a few, the basic tool (which is part of the deluxe package) does the job just fine."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"I made the mistake of using an old saw and using this saw as my opener. I just wanted a pair of the best locks I could find and the TK-38 is my favorite. It is so much easier to operate than the one I had with the old saw. The TK-38 is a great knife for the price and is made well. I've had it for about a year now and I love it. The blade is smooth and a perfect knife for the job. I've used it for the past year, and I'm very pleased with the results. I'm a professional and am a good customer. I love the way my car looks.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I've used several different Hoovers and Eurekas in recent years, so I have some perspective on vacuum cleaners in this price category, both bagged and bagless, and so far, I'm finding the Bissell measures up well.  I didn't think of Bissell as a top vacuum cleaner brand (I think of them as making rug shampooers), but I've been impressed.

PROS:

It has good suction--my first use produced that ""Wow"" when you see how much dirt was in the carpet you thought was pretty clean;

It has multiple filters that are washable, so there are no maintenance costs for bags or filters;

The powered upholstery attachment with spinning beater brush works great--much better than just having a little brush attachment that pushes the hair around;

It's extremely easy to assemble (one screw);

It's sturdy and solid for the price;

It's not the lightest I've used (that would be the Eureka Lightspeed, which started to fall apart almost immediately), but it's not overly heavy or bulky--it's a good weight;

It's no more noisy than any of the other similarly-priced vacuums I've used;

The extension hose doesn't have to be placed into a hole every time you want to use it and then pulled out afterwards, unlike some other models--it's always attached to the suction, so all you have to do is pull it out and start using it; and

The canister comes off and goes back in very easily--more easily than some I've used--and can be easily emptied.

CONS:

I find little to complain about with this unit, but like all of the other vacuum cleaners I've used, the cord doesn't retract, so you have to always keep it out of the way as you vacuum.  Others have said the cord could be longer; I find it's about average, but sure, a little longer wouldn't hurt (although then there's more to keep out of the way)."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I have used this whisk for a couple of weeks and I really love it. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office.

I can also use them for additional food storage in the fridge or pantry if I need to.

This fits the bill. It's easy to haul, store, use and clean (and sadly I have had opportunity to use it regularly!)"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Great product for the price.  Very bright and the changing colors are great.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I have enjoyed using this coffeemaker on a daily basis.  I have not had the error problem that some reviewers have mentioned but I use a travel mug to fill the container for the single brew side which keeps it from overfilling. ,  I can't speak to the durability as yet since  have only had it for about 3 weeks but it works very well so far.
Update 9/21/14:  Have now had this for about 10 months.  It still works very well; am using on a daily basis and have not even had to do any deep cleaning(vinegar rinse etc).  Have been very satisfied with brew results from the k cups and from the carafe.  Not as satisfied with the single cup loose grounds brew though; don't use that option very often so haven't mastered the right portion of water for the strength I want.
The only errors I have had is when I wanted to brew a single cup but left the selector on the carafe setting.  That's ok thought as long as the carafe is always left in place because the single cup will just come out into the carafe. If you do not leave the carafe in place all the time though you would have a cup of coffee pouring onto the counter. If you do the opposite though and leave the selector on the single cup setting when you want to brew a carafe, it will not cause a problem because the machine just gives an error message and doesn't let the water come through - very clever, almost foolproof design."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I bought an 8 pack of these and have been replacing the CFL bulbs in the house as they burn out.  I've been much happier with these.  Sure they are more expensive, but I expect them to last ""forever"".  So especially in those pain-in-the-butt-to-change bulb locations (you know the ones I mean) you want to replace with these.  Also the much lower power is great.  I replaced some old incandescents which were actually overheating themselves, and these are so much better.

I have gotten Cree daylight spectrum for outside the house security lights and it looks amazingly clear.  For inside the house, these Soft/Warm lights are much better, I find, but it's up to personal preference.  They have a nice glow to them rather than the harsh LED light you might be familiar with if you bought some of the earlier or cheap ones.  Try these, you'll love them, save power, and change bulbs much less often.  Win, win, win."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Buy in big box store, Save Receipt! Bought dec 1, 2014 from BBB, and it is still working !
Yes, it is cheap for the money, and because the parts are all plastic you must treat it delicately,
I used only a 12 oz bottle for starters. YOU MUST USE DISTILLED WATER so no mineral build up occurs.  Yes, put solid black tape over the bright blue light to fix that issue. Has Auto Shut Off when bottle is empty. Yes, cleaning to avoid mold build up is reasonable to do. I use white vinegar as a rinse.
Allow to air dry every week. Yes, the fan is not silent, but some people like ""white noise"". This is meant to be a ""personal"" unit, meaning small and portable, takes up very little space!
  Finally, I would say get it, treat it delicately, use only DISTILLED water, and save all packaging and receipt. Mine is working for now. Will update if it fails."

This is a good tool for the money and I can't complain.  I have a Makita 12V drill and this is the one I have.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,They are hard to get up in the air but when you get one that goes up it is beautiful!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is exactly what I wanted.  I was looking for a bedspread that would be long enough to hide the metal bed rails--the bed has a headboard but no side rails or foot board.  I've been using a dust ruffle for years and, honestly, the tucking of all of the blankets, making sure the dust ruffle doesn't get caught up in the tucking, was very aggravating.  Especially since my toddler grandson naps in this bed at least twice a week.  I wanted a simpler way to make the bed after nap without having to tuck all of the blankets in.  The bed is queen size and after measuring, I determined that a queen size spread would not work--they are typically sized for use with dust ruffles or on beds with side rails and foot board.  I ordered a king size spread and turned it so the long edge runs across the width of the bed instead of the length of it.  Because there is no pattern that would dictate it be used the way it was intended, this works just great.  The spread is top quality.  After making sure it was the right fit, I washed it and put it on the bed.  It's just perfect and washed beautifully.  No odd smell, no excessive lint, no missed stitching.  This purchase also had the option of buying standard size pillow shams (king spread with standard OR king shams), which I did.  My toddler's bed looks great and will be easy to make as he gets in and out of it. I am going to check to see if it comes in other colors so I can order another one for change of seasons.  You won't go wrong with this purchase."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I Moved a few years ago and my spring-form pan left me for parts unknown. So I got another one and price was on my mind.  Hey, they all leak at this price range.  Simple to take care of, use shortening like caulking and seal the inner rim and especially where the side is connected, crimped, whatever.  This is great for regular cake batter.  Also, I use a cooking or roasting bag on the outside when making cheesecake.  Just slip in the bag and cut to size.  No muss, no fuss.  I use a razor cutter to trim along the edge.

*** Update 3/3/2016
Found a non bath cheesecake recipe and made it in this pan.  Don't have to worry about leaks.  Here it is
New York Cheesecake.
2 pounds cream cheese
3/4 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup sour cream
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
6 tablespoons melted butter
1/4 cup white sugar
Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).
2. Mix graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and 1/4 cup sugar together. Press mixture onto the bottom of one 9 or 10 inch springform pan. Place in freezer for 10 minutes.
3. Cream 3/4 cup of the sugar and cream cheese until smooth. Beat in eggs, vanilla, and cornstarch until just mixed. Stir in sour cream and mix on medium until well blended. Remember to scrape sides during mixing. Pour into prepared crust.
4. Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 10 minutes. Turn temperature down to 210 degrees and bake for 45 minutes. Turn oven off and leave cake in oven  until cool.  About 2 to 3 hours. Do NOT open oven door from the time you put it in the oven until it is cooled.  Refrigerate for at least 4 hours.  Preferably over night.  Serve with your favorite topping.

I would have given it 5 stars, except that after a couple of weeks, the foam padding on the kneeling board is showing signs of breaking down.
It will not last much longer.
I'll have to figure out a way to replace the padding with a good memory foam.
Then, it'll be a good kneeling chair.

With that said, I love the chair, or what ever you want to call it.
I've had it for about 3 weeks now.
My lower back, leg and foot problems are dissipating nicely.
I was worried that I might be turning diabetic.
A checkup confirmed that I wasn't.
The problems were most likely being caused by LONG HOURS sitting in front of a monitor.

It took a couple of weeks for my knees to begin getting used to it.
But, they're adapting nicely. Which is a good sign for anyone else because I'm in my 70's.
Anyone younger should should have an easier time getting used to it.

Using a piece of good firm memory foam on the knee board should make this an excellent kneeling chair."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I bought these for a specific reason, I build and fly R/C model planes and I have an engine mount made of unobtainium with a steel 4-40 socket head cap screw broken off below the surface. The smallest one removed it easily saving me a lot of grief.
Great addition to my toolbox."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"When I bought this it was under fifteen dollars, which is very reasonable for any sort of timer light switch product.  I installed it in my bathroom to control the exhaust fan and it works perfectly.  You need to know what you're doing in the junction box because all 4 wires need to be hooked up correctly (and there -must- be a white wire for power,) but it was not difficult and it looks nice along side the other switches."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"We use this with our toddler as a ""learning tower."" It is the perfect height for her to stand on and reach the kitchen counter. She is 2.5, so she have the motor ability and skill level to stay up on this step stool and help when we cook or do things in the kitchen. I also use this around the house as a regular step stool. We have a small kitchen, so I like that I can fold this and keep it out of the way. A large wooden learning tower would not work well for our space at all. This definitely wouldn't work with a younger baby as a learning tower. Use your judgment. You know your child and their ability to stand on a stool without falling.. if you decide to use this as a learning tower too."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"When I was a young woman, I thought it would be a nice piece of equipment to have.

But the box I received was a bit too large for me. I wanted to go to a store and get a large piece of equipment for my kitchen. I ordered this for the kitchen. It is a bit smaller than I thought but I am not sure why. I also ordered a small set of bowls for my kitchen. They are too large for me. I am not sure why. I would not order the smaller set. I am happy with this purchase. I have a larger set of bowls but they are not as large as I wanted. I would not recommend this item. I would recommend this item to anyone.I bought these to make my sandwich sandwiches for my family.  They are a little hard to pull off the paper and are a bit too small for my small sandwich bowls.  I was afraid they would break.  So far they are holding up well.  The only reason I gave 5 stars is because they are so thin.  I would not recommend these to anyone.  I would recommend to anyone that is very thin and needs to use a regular sized sandwich to make sandwiches.I have a nice white kitchen curtain that is perfect for my needs.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"I purchased this blender on a whim and thought it would be a nice addition to the kitchen. It's not. I am a firm believer that if you don't get it right it's going to break in the dishwasher. I have had this for two weeks now and love it. I love the fact that I can use the blender with a single hand. I just can't get it to do it all. I have a hard time adjusting the motor speed to make sure it works the right way, but I'm not sure how I feel about that. The motor is a little loud at first, but it's great."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I used this to prop up a large tree and it was a nice piece of equipment.  It is so small that it would be impractical to get around with it.  I used it to make a little makeshift tree outside a tree on a busy road and it

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,I have wanted one of these for awhile now and decided to purchase this one for the first time. It's not the best but it's good enough to be worth the money.I have used this bulb in the past and I am very pleased. I have used it in the past with no problems. I have also used it with a 60 watt incandescent bulb and it has been very effective.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I own several different Porter-Cable air nailers, so this was an easy selection for me.  The gun is lightweight; the integrated tool hook is very useful (though made of plastic); and it's great not have to oil the unit whenever it's used.  I've been fortunate to have tried similar products from Paslode, Rigid, and Bostitch.  These are all great manufacturers, too.  However, for the money saved, I'd readily stack the Porter-Cable up against any other tool of its ilk.  If properly cared for (like most things in life), then there's no reason why this nailer won't last as long, and perform as well, as more expensive units on the market."

I still use it every day, and it's great. I recommend it for anyone who is looking for a sharpener that will make a difference in your kitchen. These are great. I just wish they were a bit longer.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"There are aerators and then some containers and the only thing I can think of is the size of the bottom so it's a little small.  The box itself is a nice size and the color is beautiful.  It's a perfect size for my dogs and cats.  The packaging is great.  I have a large dog and a small dog and it fits perfectly.  I will say that I love the colors and the size and they are great for a small dog.  I am very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend it to anyone.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.I purchased this as a gift.  I had some other candles and this one does the job perfectly.  It is a bit smaller than the ones that I have, but the candles are great for my bed.  I wish it had a larger size.  I would have given it 5 stars.This is a great little mixer.  It's small enough to fit my old bread mixer and it works great.  The mixer seems to be a little bigger than I expected.  However, the size is perfect for my kitchen.  It's perfect for my dining room table.  The mixer is very quiet and easy to use.  I like that it is made of aluminum so that it doesn't have a handle.  The mixer works well and is a bit easier to use.  I haven't tried the mixer on the kitchen counter yet, but I'll see how that turns out.I really like the color of this pillow case"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"Markings are clear, tape can extend to approximately 8 feet without flexing. I liked the concept of the self locking bit, seemed very handy.  First project I needed it for I had to measure from the wall to a spot on the ceiling.  After at least a dozen tries I could not keep the extended tape steady.  I tried different angles, pointing it up, sideways and backwards.  No go; it kept flexing.  Worst of all, the tape did not lock as advertised.  I could not get an accurate measurement, even on the floor.  If I extended the tape past 6 feet, it slowly retracted on its own approx. 1/8 inch.  That happening once I could live with.  Repeatedly?  No thanks.  Returned it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"The product is good - the blades are sharp, the whole device feels solid and heavy in the hand, and it does work on meat as advertised, however, there's one significant point where the product description is false.  The product listing says that this specific model is ""Made in the USA"" and it's NOT.  The packaging on my Jaccard Super 3 clearly states ""Designed in USA. Made in China.""  So that little bit of false advertising made me deduct one star.

EDITED:  I just read the other reviews, and one reviewer pointed out that this $37 item is the exact same product as a $17 item that's being sold by another 3rd-party seller.  I actually did notice the other seller's item before I purchased mine, I just chose this one because the description says it was made in the USA.  Again, it's NOT made in the USA, it is made in China.  The seller's description is basically false advertising. And if it's the exact same item as the one that's less than half the price, then that makes THIS product at THIS price a total rip-off."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I purchased this to replace the Capresso 560 grinder after it broke. The Capresso grinder is quieter, but I love the simplicity of this grinder. Unfortunately, although it is less messy than any other grinder I have owned, coffee grounds do get on the counter and cling to the nozzle after a few uses. Cleaning it is simple, but sort of a hassle because you need to empty out all of the beans. Overall I love this grinder. It has saved me money by consistently grinding the exact amount of coffee I want with no guess work or groggy counting. I like the appearance, but the lid is disappointing. Rather than matching the black and silver grinder it is an ugly grey. I wish Breville would have kept with the sleek black look."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,CG,"First of all, we loved this set and the materials. I also love that it's been one of the best purchases we've made, and that the light is a nice, strong, and comfortable light. It's not a large, bulky light. I like that it has a lot of light, but it's also compact and has a very low profile. I like that it's made of very high quality materials, and that it is made in the USA.

Overall, this light is a great value for the price. I highly recommend it for anyone who needs a nice light that will last a long time.I used this to replace the old glass door to get the new one I had.  I was using the old one and I had"

I thought, jeez the most recent review looks to be 2011, there should be an improvement by now... lol, nope. I finally removed the thing, got one of those magnetic base work lights with a stiffer goose neck, stuck it to the DeWalt metal stand, problem solved for now. I may try mounting the Dewalt light directly to the stand by drilling two holes, bolt it down and orient the goose neck vertical instead of horizontal... it might possilbly bear the weight of the lamp better and not sag."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Just the price and size for my wife and myself. I have cooked 7 meals since we bought it and its great.  The Crock comes out and goes right into the dishwasher as well as the cover.  Best Crock Pot we have had so far in many a year.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I've only had loud, centrifugal juicers before, which were 1/3 the price of this one, and did a fine job, but I mainly used it for fruit juice and carrot juice.  They weren't good for juicing green leafy vegetables though, and the mesh bowl and spinning blade were always a pain to clean.  This one comes apart and goes back together very easy, and is VERY easy to clean.  You don't even need a dishwasher.  It juices everything the centrifugal models do, PLUS leafy greens like collards, kale, swiss chard, cabbage, parsely, etc.  And it's quiet while running.  Of course it is much more expensive, but it's built well and has a powerful motor (you could probably juice rocks with this thing - though I wouldn't recommend trying that).  The only real negative for me is that the feed tube is only like 1.5 inches in diameter.  So there's more prep time involved, cutting up the apple into slices that will fit, for example - whereas the centrifugal models have a large feed chute that will take the whole apple, tomato, etc, as-is."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,CG,I do not need  this.  It is a good tool.  I would recommend it.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"So far, so good.  We have the wide-angle flashlight, and the wide-angle one.  The range is great.  We have the light we use in our kitchen, and it's bright enough to see outside without a flashlight.  This one is still far too small for us."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,I am using the box to store accessories for a hobby and not for tools.  The size was just what I wanted and the price was right.  I find the box to be well made.  The lid aligns nicely with the base when you close it so the latches work perfectly every time.  Overall I recommend this box.

I also use them to wash my nails and they do not stain.  I have a hard time cleaning"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,Very creaky.  Not a good buy.  The slats kept falling out because they weren't cut long enough.  You will probably have to get a metal platform base in addition to this frame.  I did.  Better to buy something else that's actually solid wood.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,I just tested this drill and it works fine.  I will update my review if I find any other problems.  The plastic parts are solid and the plastic part is a bit large but it's okay.  I would definitely buy this drill again if I
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"Nice little tool and am convinced some of the features can actually be used successfully in a survival situation if practiced and done with care.  For example, the compass has to be completely level to work.  If not it will jam and give wrong direction.  I would suggest that this  be used as a fun training tool to acquaint people with the skills needed to survive in the wilderness, e.g. navigation, fire starting, weather forecasting.  However, I would opt for much better equipment if I was on a wilderness hike where I might encounter these challenges."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"Overall, I like this vacuum.  I have an old one that I used for a couple of years.  I have had it for a couple of months now and it works great.  The only thing I wish it were a little higher was it would have made cleaning easier.  I also love the 2 filters that come with it.  I have a hard time getting the filter into the container when I have to use it to filter water.  I have a hard time cleaning the water after using it.  I have a hard time cleaning the water after it has been stored in a refrigerator or freezer.  I have a hard time getting it in the dishwasher.  I do like the color and the fact that it has a rubberized seal.  It is also a little heavier.  I don't have to worry about the metal being broken.  I like the fact that it has a plastic cover that makes cleaning easier.  I like the fact that it is a little bigger than my old vacuum.  I have been using it for several months now and it is doing a good job.  I am very happy with the purchase.Very nice and sturdy!  Perfect for what I need it for!I'm using this on my bed for a couple of weeks now. It works perfectly.  The fact that it's stainless steel is a nice touch.  It's easy to clean and doesn"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,Not really effective at all.  This is NOT tacky like the original product. It does not hold a candle in place at all.  it is not thick.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Hey folks, some of you have complained about not being able to get your hand into the disposal to pull things out.  Guess what -- that's a very intentional design measure to protect you by keeping you from putting hands where they don't belong.  If the beast can grind up beef bones, guess what it will do to your hand!!!!  Maybe you think the disposal is safe when turned off, but so have people who considered a gun as safe when they didn't realize if was loaded.  It would be nice if the design didn't have to deal with abuse, misuse and stupidity -- but unfortunately it does.  Don't make yourself a victim.

If you accidentally drop something into the disposal, use tongs of some sort to retrieve the item -- NOT your friggin' hand. Still, be VERY careful because the motor has enough power to throw the tongs at you VERY forcefully."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"BEST brand in multi-tool market period!! reason I bought this one was I lost my other 'wave' model on a big wildland fire our engine had to work (big bummer) and wasn't able to get a free or cheaper replacement so i bought the same one due to it's great durability, selection of tools, and craftiness. One of the best plus's about this model is the tini scissor tool that is great for keeping the uniforms clean trimmed, cutting gauze and mole skin on the fire-line, and even opening the mail! GREAT JOB! thank you!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"Bought this for use on the fire dept as an emergency back up tool. You never know when you are going to have to cut something quick and this seemed to fit the bill. Used to carry a pocket clip style knife (Kershaw) but wanted a razor sharp tool and figured you couldn't get any sharper than an actual razor. I wanted this to be able to cut sheet rock or a seat belt in an emergency situation and standard cardboard boxes around the station . I've had this for many months now it is just not ""cutting it"" The build seems great at first, this thing is really heavy. Unfortunately the build is not that great. The quick release mechanism is already slipping and it doesn't close properly. It feels like its going to break soon. I have actually put this to use maybe a couple dozen times since I received it. (not a whole lot) For the price I thought I was getting a deal but you really do get what you pay for. I compared mine to others who carry the folding box cutters at my station and although my Sheffield looks way better than any of theirs the functionality is not up to par. If you need an occasional junk drawer blade this will work fine. If you are looking for a ""worker"" knife keep looking."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"""Works as advertised"" is a nice touch, as long as you keep your hands on the handle and keep them from falling over. I am using it for the instruction booklet.Great quality and nice color.  Just wish it came in a bit bigger.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one to become a complete mess. I wanted a great item to replace a broken one that I had. I purchased this item for my wife and she is thrilled with it. It is a very nice looking item. She loves it.I ordered these after reading some of the reviews and was surprised at how well they worked.  They do work well for my purposes, but the ""raw"" materials aren't ideal for a few things.  My 3 year old loves the color, but the metal is uneven.  I'm not sure what she would be pleased with.  She will love it.  She has a lot of experience with metal and this is the first one she has used.  She loves that it has a removable lid so she can keep her fingers from scratching the metal.  She doesn't like the metal being made from metal, but she is very happy with this product.  I would recommend this product to anyone.I got this in the mail today and was pleasantly surprised with it.  I didn't realize the price of the item until I received it.  I haven't tried it yet, but I am sure it will be better than the $200 item that I paid for it.  It works great and keeps the coffee hot for about 10 hours.  I haven't used it yet,"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I am very pleased with this set and the quality. I will keep my review for future reference.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,This is the second one of these I have owned.  This one lasted just a little over a year.  The bottom cracks and it leaks.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"My wife and I have been using the wide wooden legs for a long time, and this one is a great solution. The plastic parts are very sturdy, and the holes are very large. I have had no issues with the legs sticking out. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a long wooden leg.

I did have some issues with the opening on the back of the legs, but I will keep it that way. The metal is very sturdy, and I am very pleased with this product. It is very heavy, and does not move around. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a long wooden leg.I love the concept. It makes a great cup of coffee for my family. I also like the color and the design. It's also a good quality. I wish it had been a little larger, but I haven't found it.Works great!I really like these. They are very soft and soft. I use them to hang a sheet of fabric and they do the job. They are very soft and comfortable to sleep on.I used this on my kitchen counter top.  It works well and was very easy to put together.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This really isn't even the same tool as the 2-ton cable puller.  I mean it is, but this thing is MASSIVE.  It weighs about 35 pounds and looks able to pull a house over.  The thing is so big it's almost difficult to work with.  You need to be rather strong to get it moved around set up even before you begin cranking.

This is very well made, of exceptional quality, and amazingly strong.  Made right here in the good old USA.  You can buy this thing, use the tar out of it, and give it to your grown child someday and he can then give it to his kid some day.  Really, it's that well made.  I just wish the manual did a little better job of indicating lubrication points.  Perhaps if it had a picture with arrows indicating spots to lubricate."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Until LED's came along I was regularly changing light bulbs in my house, and they aren't cheap. These are more costly but you get the money back in longevity. At this point most of the lights in our home are LEDs, and almost all of them are by FEIT. In the last two years since I started switching over to these I've only had one go bad out of about 30-40  lamps.

They produce less heat than incandescents. This saves you more money when you are cooling your house, less money when you were warming it anyway with a furnace. But either way, less heat generated.

The light is whiter than incandescent.

They dim down to a point then go out suddenly. They may buzz a little when dimmed, depending on the quality of dimmer you use. Some dimmers are not designed for LED or CFL bulbs.

I called the FEIT hotline to find out how you can take advantage of the lifetime warranty. They said you don't need the packaging, just the bulb and the receipt."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,These hangers are very good quality. The only problem is that they are not really the same color.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"We got these dishes for our motorhome. Not only were they priced right and durable, what they were made of and where they were made were also huge factors in our purchase.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This fruit basket was not my first choice. But when I checked my wish list and saw this at an unbelievable price, I couldn't pass up the deal. With that said, this fruit basket far surpassed my expectations. I am honestly glad I didn't go with my first choice. This basket is modern, stylish, and very functional. There is enough clearance from the banana hanger so the bananas do not interfere with the fruit, and its a bonus that the basket itself is very deep. The fruit basket was just slightly bigger than I though it to be, but that's not really a problem for me. The brown is pretty dark, so if you are worried it will clash with other colors in your kitchen it won't. In my kitchen I have a lot of brown accents all over; at first glance it does look black, but after looking for a couple more seconds you see that it is in fact brown. Either way, you can't go wrong with this basket."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Just what I was looking for. Got these for mini desserts just like at the restaurant Seasons 52. I think they are actually the same ones.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I received it today and started using it right away. Its easy to use and it comes with labels. You don't have to use the labels they have made up.

I have a couple of other tools that I use to light things up with and a couple of these lights I keep in the house.  They are bright enough to light up a room or a room I'm working in and they are so easy to use and so easy to find.  I've used the light for a few years now and it works great!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"The pictures clearly show brown furniture and it is advertised as tri-tone brown, but it is not brown. I have numerous different shades of brown furniture in my living room, hardwood floors, and brown wall decor, and none of them make the couch look like the picture. Without a doubt, the furniture is purple. It clashes with everything in our house. The visitors we had over last week called it ""merlot,"" which I believe is a very accurate description. The legs are black and look very cheap (I plan on replacing them).

However, if you think you would like a merlot-colored furniture set, this is a good one for the price. I really like the styling and the leather is quite soft. Even though it is genuine leather, the color is a treatment applied only to the top layer (the color does not saturate the leather), so if you scratch it - or if your cats scratch it - it will be noticeable. We have been staining the scratches as they occur and I think it is an acceptable solution.

Bottom line: the styling is great and it is a very nice looking set, except that the color is not as advertised. We would be 99% happy with the purchase if it would have arrived in any shade of brown whatsoever. If you can get past the color, I think you'll have a hard time matching the quality of this 3 piece set for the price."

I had a similar model before and used it a couple of times and it was still working well. I would definitely buy this one again if I could.

It's very easy to clean and holds a lot of liquid, so I would definitely recommend it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Hard to find smaller food quality glasses. This my second set.  I mixed them with the fleur de lis design.  Perfect size cocktail glass.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I over all like Panasonic products a lot and have been happy with them. This rice cooker is, however, different. The flawed design is that this one does not have an holder to collect the steam water that runs off the cover when you open the cooker. The water just collect at the rim on the edge. When water is too much or you do not give it time to evaporate on its own, it drains down. One of the danger is that it drains down to the electric socket located at the bottom of the cooker. I returned it because of this poor design, it can cause a short circuit. Please note that not every time the water will drain down that far or it will drain into the socket head on, but for me it is too much a chance to take."

I also like the fact that the light is adjustable so it's not so much in the way of walking around. This is a great feature for the price. I have a portable light that I can use for a walk or bike ride. I just put it on my car and it works great. I have two of these on my phone. I've used the light for a couple of months now and it's just fine. I've found that it is really bright and it's very useful. It's not a full size light, but it's nice to have something that's more light than I've had before. I also like that the battery is made of metal and I can recharge it quickly. I recommend this light to anyone who is looking for a rechargeable flashlight. I've had mine for a couple of months now and it's very bright. I've seen some reviews that said it would be more expensive than a standard compact flashlight. But it's not. I don't have any flashlights that cost more than this one, so it's not a great deal for a small flashlight. But if you're looking for a cheap compact flashlight that you can recharge quickly, this is a great buy. The quality is good and the light is good quality. It's heavy and I like that it's bright."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Good quality, does a very good job, and the instructions are very easy to follow."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I really love these night lights! They are slim, visually appealing, and very bright without being glaring. My old night lights had the sensors mounted on top, which could present problems when used in locations under kitchen cabinets or other areas that were ""shaded"". The senors on these lights are in the center and work no matter how they are plugged in. I like to use mine in the top receptacle, leaving the bottom one free for plugging in other things. This also makes the 3 way switch easily accessible from the top. Yes!!! I did say 3 way switch! You have the options of two brightness settings, and can turn the unit off without unplugging it. This is so very handy for me because I work nights and don't need to leave things lit up while I am at work. If you want access to the top receptacle, and don't need easy access to the switch, you can flip it over and plug it into the bottom. Easy!!! The ""HIGH"" setting really lights up my bathroom for those nocturnal visits. I never liked to turn the lights in in there if I am half-awake and plan on jumping back in bed after the deed is done.

Some people may not like being able to see the separate LEDs glowing in the ring, but I find it to be very decorative. I also like the bluish glow they give out much better than a glaring white or yellow light. Place a few of these in some strategic locations, and you'll have no trouble navigating through your darkened house at night. Fumbling in the dark for the light switch will be a thing of the past. You get two for this great price. Have a basement? Get at least two more! Two of these has replaced four of the old style lights for me. I'll never go back!

I was given this product in return for my unbiased and honest evaluation."

I was able to use it for some coffee and it still works. It's a bit smaller than I thought but I think it's a good enough cup. I just wish it came with a little more storage on top. I bought this for a friend who uses to bake her cookies. It is a little too large for our small cake pans. We needed something that would fit in the back of a cake pan."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I'm going to start this review with an honest confession: if I needed a wet/dry vac on a regular basis, I would probably rate this product much lower. But, I don't need one very often - consequently, this style is ideal and rates a four star as related to my needs.

1) It doesn't take up a lot of space. Because it just snaps onto the top of a bucket, there is no need to store a full apparatus. This simply stays in a plastic tub with several other resources, ready to be pulled out.
2) The needed bucket is a very commonplace one. You're not going to get this and be annoyed because you don't have just the right bucket - unless, of course, the bucket you own is a rather odd one in the first place.
3) It's very easy to use, Just snap the motor onto the bucket, put the hose in place, and you're ready to go.
4) The suction is good. Strong enough to suck a wet spot dry.

So, are there negatives? Yes, even for my usage, there are a few negatives to this product.
1) The power cord is short. Either pull out an extension cord, or deal with limited access. The hose is also short, but that's only relevant if you have issues getting the bucket close enough to the mess needing to be cleaned up.
2) The hose needs to be attached before the motor is connected to the bucket. Not because that's order of operations, but because the two openings are not labeled.
3) They dry vac bag is rather small. Since this is considered useful for sucking debris that's a little too large for a normal vacuum, the collection bag could be a bit bigger.

I can think of several past household situations - leaks, washer issues, plumbing problems, etc. - when this would have been a handy tool. Not enough to need a full-fledged wet vac, but enough that something like this would have been worth having around."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,They work great. I also use it as a measuring cup for measuring cupcakes.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Bought this on Amazon back in December. I didn't like this light for about a month. It is somewhat bulky feeling because of the shape of the barrel. After I used it for a while it stopped bothering me.

If you run it constantly, yes it will kill the batteries. However I've found that to be true with all penlights that are bright.

I had this at a lake fishing one night not to long ago. I let someone use it and they dropped it out off their mouth in about 5' of water. It was a man made fishing dock. There was no safe way of getting into the water unless you walked to the other end of the dock then swam all the way back. It was dark and late so I left my &19.99 investment lay at the bottom.

We fished for a few more hours. When we left the light had been submerged for over 2 hours and it was still on. Even still somewhat bright.

So for the light it gives off and the toughness of the light I'm giving it 5 stars.

I could dock it a star for the bulky feeling of the light on your hand but I think the pros outweighs the con in this case.

Now that the price has gone up  I should've went for a long swim that night."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Got this the other day as a ""daily special"" for an extra $23 off.  VERY easy to install (especially after watching the short install video provided here on Amazon).  If I can install it successfully, ANYONE can.  I had more trouble getting my crusty 15-year old lock off than I did installing this one.

There is one thing that should be pointed out - when you test the ""keyless"" lock operation, it gives you a few seconds to change your mind before actually engaging the lock - so when you install this and then test out that feature, it can seem as though the lock is not locking if you IMMEDIATELY turn it back to ""test"" it - you have to lock, then wait a couple of seconds."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,A great accessory for any 3/8 ratchet system. Allows for greater reach in hard to reach places. Or allows a bit of distance to get a better leverage in tight areas.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I have been an organic apple cider vinegar user for a couple decades now. What started me on it was talking to someone one day about how they would drink a tablespoon of it daily for a chronic heartburn issue. Well, that is all I had to hear to try it. Next time I went shopping I bought some with the mother in it. I am one of the crazy sorts that enjoy it straight up. LOL. However, I do add it to water most days. I can't imagine not having it on hand so when I was offered this, I figured it would be great to try since I've only used Bragg's in the past.

The reason for the 4 stars is because I have not found what I feel to be the 'mother' in either bottle. There is some sediment but I haven't found the mother. I am also not to the bottom but when I shake a bottle of ACV the mother usually makes itself known. I'm not an expert and only have the one brand for comparison but I am used to SEEING the mother. I do not use apple cider vinegar with the mother for anything other than food-related. For household cleaning and disinfecting, I just use plain white vinegar. I feel this stuff is too good for that. One of my absolute favorite ways is in the summer with fresh cucumbers. I slice up cucumbers and onions and put them in a bowl with ACV, water, salt & pepper. Let that sit in the fridge and yummo. I always make my own salad dressing with it as well. I received this product at a discount for my evaluation and honest review."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Prior to purchasing this kettle I had used an all steel kettle on my flat glass range.  I hate this stove because I have to be so careful heating things (it heats by magnetic induction so if the pot/pan/kettle has no metal, it won't heat it very well).  I had tried this glass kettle flat on the surface but it took 30 minutes to boil water (minimal magnetic stuff in this glass).  I was concerned about it cracking, but it survived as long as I ramped the heat up slowly and didn't just crank it.  I then tried various heat diffusors (cast iron grate, some other wire zig zag thing I had) but the best one is the clover metal wire that came with the kettle.  It now takes 10-15 minutes to boil water (it took 5 minutes in my metal kettle, but then my water tasted like metal).  Even when I straight up crank the stove temp to high, the kettle has shown no signs of breakage.  My only complaint which may be my stoves fault, is that even though no glass is touching the surface, I am still developing a brown halo stain around my burner.  What am I burning?  Air?  is something coming off of the glass?  I doubt it.  But I cant blame the kettle as it is doing its job even on my crummy stove.  Also the clover diffuser burns a stain into the glass, but with enough 409 and some elbow grease, and steel wool, I can get the stains off.

I have only been using this kettle for a month and the handle has not yet loosened, like so many reviewers are complaining.  If anything changes, I will update my review."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This is a great lamp with clean simple lines and an attractive brushed steel finish. What I like best is how it's totally stable yet has a very small footprint. The flat base is heavy and totally sturdy and only about a third of an inch thick. Since other objects on your desk or bedside table can sit on the flat base or the base can slip under other things, it effectively takes up almost no space. I got one of these for my bedside table four or five years ago and like it so much I just bought two more. The small ""handle"" (short bar) attached to the head is the only thing about it that strikes me as potentially at all flimsy, and it's not really necessary. I can adjust the angle of the neck easily with one hand. Most of the time the 25watt is plenty bright and I don't need 50watt very often. I'd prefer a switch I can push on-and-off on the lamp itself to the wheel switch that's attached partway down the power cord, but it's not a big deal. A switch on the base or the arm would require them to be thicker and spoil the simple design, so I keep the five stars. I got this lamp after I was disappointed with several cheaper (potentially dangerous) halogen desk lamps bought at local stores and swore I'd never buy a cheap one again. You can find halogen desk lamps that are a lot cheaper and you can find ones that are a lot more expensive, but I haven't seen one yet that's a better value for the price."

I have a ""Florida"" room that everyone uses as an entrance because it is the door closest to the driveway.  When someone came into that room at night and I always leave that door open, I would never know it and they might fall before they got to the doorbell. When I came in that way at night  I would need a flashlight. Now I know everyone is safe when they come in the door because the light comes on right away. Deliveries from UPS etc. are made in good lighting now. I just don't have anything negative to say about it. I have had it a few months Without a problem. My husband just told me he loves it too.

Animals don't set it off because it is set to come on only when you step inside the door.

 I had the same problem with the battery dying, I found the solution,thankfully:
Ok so I figured it out. When there is a LOT of activity like I had with a cookout you should probably turn it off until after the party but if the battery goes down and it stops working just turn it off and let it charge up again for three days like you did when it was new.  I will buy more now that I know the battery doesn't  need replacing just because it went weak from excessive use. I really do LOVE it for my ""Florida"" room and will get more for my other doors."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"This is one of the few times amazon reviews have let me down. I bought this to have on hand whenever I made my own dressings or sauces that might be used over the course of a few days. My bottle got pushed towards the back of the cupboard and I forgot about it, until I moved and decided I should make use of it since I finally had space for everything.

The first time I went to use it, however, liquid droplets went flying everywhere with the first few shakes! I thought maybe the lid wasn't tight enough, but it still leaked. I held down the flip cap, but still wound up with ingredients running down my arm. It was such a disappointing mess, and the bottle wouldn't exactly look right or be any more functional than any other bottle sans crappy screwtop that I just threw it away (a rarity for me, since I hate throwing away things.)

I was pretty shocked at how useless it was since I remembered the glowing reviews my fellow Amazonians had given it, and because I have other Norpro products that are fairly above-average in terms of functionality and usefulness.

The bottle's looks were pretty plain and utilitarian but I'd overlooked that for the sake of function, but now I think next time I'd prefer a prettier bottle even if it doesn't have useful features like a screw-on lid or flip top cap, since they could likely just be made of fail anyway."

I'm going to leave the stupid label to interfere with my using the electric cord, safely! Time to design a lamp for the modern bulb, fluorescent or LED. Otherwise, this lamp provides a convenient but basic light."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Love this pillow.  I am a side sleeper and my hubby steals my pillows usually.  This one takes conscious effort to move so it has not been stolen out from under my head in the middle of the night.  It stays cool and keeps it's shape well.  The outside cover comes of for easy washing.  Great pillow.
NOTE:  If your hubby/partner likes to fold your pillows in half and lay on them then make sure to order an extra one because they are definitely not as nice after that happens.  It's like after being squished like that they lose a bit of their soul."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Awesome showerhead, I was concerned that it might be too tight for my hand, but I was just about ready to go. The shower head is very small, and the cover is very large. I was concerned about the head falling out, but it's not really that big. The shower head is a bit smaller than I expected, but I can't tell you how long it will last. I just wish it was a bit longer, and it will be fine. Overall, I am very happy with this showerhead. It's really nice to have it, and I'm very happy with it. It's definitely a better showerhead than the one I bought. I am very happy with it. I got this to replace an old wall lamp with a new one. It's a great little light, the only drawback is the metal screws are a bit too long for my small hand. I'm hoping this will last a long time."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,CG,"Bought this a month ago and it works fine.  I will update this review if I find any other problems.  The plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large.  The bulb is not in the same position as the rest of the bulbs.  The light is not a very bright white, and it will not light up the area around the base of the flashlight.  It will not be able to illuminate the area around the flashlight.

The only issue I have is that it is not bright enough for most people.  It will not be able to illuminate the area around the base of the flashlight.  It is not as bright as a standard halogen bulb, and it does not provide enough light for most people.  It is also not as bright as a standard halogen bulb, but it is not going to be able to illuminate the area around the flashlight.  I have not used it as a flashlight yet, but I will update this review if I find any problems.

I have a number of other halogen lights that I have purchased, and this one is the one that I would recommend.  It is very bright, and it will provide a good amount of light.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"I ultimately ended up sending these back.  Here's why...

In my last home, I outfitted everything with GE Reveal bulbs.  It's the best light there is in my opinion and I wanted a similar look in my new home but wanted to make the switch over to LED everywhere.  I figured daylight would be the best solution so I bought these.  Wrong.  It's on the higher spectrum of daylight and really makes everything look pale/grey-bluish. I didn't care for the color at all and only realized after some research that there's more to the color temp that makes the Reveal bulb so good.  Anyway, I changed it out for a warm white which although slightly yellow is more pleasing than the harsh color of these.  I just wish someone would sell a 4200k bulb which would be ideal.

In comparison to a standard halogen, the heat difference is noticeable.  These are nowhere near as hot and should save me in the end in regards to power bills.  Although the spread is listed at 45 degrees, I feel halogen bulbs were a little wider just from the nature of the bulb.  These seem very focused at 45 degrees so the kitchen doesn't seem quite as bright as with the halogens.  Overall, I pleased enough to stick with the LED change."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,This little guy works pretty well!  I've had it for around two years now and it has held up to daily use in my house.  I'd definitely recommend it.  This can opener has held up better than any of the models I've owned in the past.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Very nice product.  Was very easy to add strip LED lighting and create professional looking enclosed LED shelf lighting.  The angle helps direct the light in and it looks great.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These are a great purchase for the money. These are quality bags, and I have had my share of bags over the years. I would definitely recommend these. They also look nice."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I have learned that the ""GU10"" bulbs, whether they be halogen or LED, are usually much less in price than those regular screw-in (""old fashioned"") bulbs. This little gizmo will convert a GU10 bulb to fit one of those regular fixture sockets. And it does it well! The GU10 bulb has two connector prongs (it's called ""bayonet base"") to connect to the power source, these posts being quite similar to the connectors of old fluorescent ""starters"" in days of yore. But, alas, you may very well be a bit too young to remember those.

I do not know why bulbs with this type of bayonet connector are priced less than the screw-in type, but with using these adapters, your purchases of the GU10 bulbs will be less (usually) than buying bulbs with the regular type base. You'll add about an inch overall to the height (or would that be length) of what the GU10 bulb would be if it were affixed into a bayonet base style socket. But for the most part GU10 bulbs are much shorter than their regular base counterparts - so not a prob.

I'm thinking that you'll recoup your $$$ using these for the very first time (not to mention how much you'll save on electricity if you switch to LED bulbs)."

Anyway I like this stuff. It's not the best one I've used, it doesn't smell great like the others but it does help to remove the odor... fooor a few days. Yeah it doesn't seem to last super long. It's mostly my hiking boots and workout shoes that start to smell a little.

The powder options last much longer for keeping the smell away but they're just so messy. I end up getting powder all over my house from when I take off my shoes and walk around in my socks. This one, I don't have to deal with that. So to me, that's an ok trade. I'm still on my first can of this stuff and I've had it for a while so it DOES still last a while."

We bought this one in the hopes it would be a better deal.  It is very sturdy and the rubber parts are great for holding the baby and the baby is very soft.  It has a very nice height for the baby and it is pretty strong.  I like that the rubber parts are not too firm to get into the mold.  I use this mold for our first baby shower and it is super soft and comfortable.  I do wish it had a little more of a grip on the mold.  It is a bit flimsy but for the price it is a good deal.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,"DID NOT WORK FIRST TIME

I had to go through the instructions for it to work. I was pretty disappointed. If you want to get a solid solid product, you have to take it apart first. It was hard to get the screws to tighten. If you are replacing a drill press, you have to take it apart first. If you are replacing a screwdriver, you have to take it apart first. This screwdriver is a great tool. It works great.This is a great tool for small jobs. It works well for smaller jobs. I'm not sure why I got it for this price, but it's definitely a good value.I've used this one to get around a ceiling fan on my garage. I don't know if it's the one that I've had since I was a kid, or the one that I used to use to get around the ceiling fan. It was very well made and was easy to use. It was easy to install. I bought a couple of additional sets of the other one for the garage. They are all excellent."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"I'm very disappointed in this product. The quality is just not good. The opener is a bit difficult to get off the dishwasher, but that is the only reason I gave it 5 stars. The blades are not sharp enough to get the butter from the bottom to the edge of the pan. The pan is very thin and it will not hold the butter evenly. I wish I'd seen a better product. I'm not sure if the metal handles hold up well to hot water, but it is a nice quality product. I would recommend this product to anyone.

Update: After several months of use, I have noticed that the handles are too short. I would recommend that you buy the other brand and get a longer handle.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"These heavy duty, kitchen scissors have many functions but if you have arthritis in your fingers the handles are a wee bit too tight. And, I was surprised that the scissors aren't quite sharp enough. The scissors come with a magnetic sheath which I attach to the side of my refrigerator. However, the magnet isn't quite strong enough & when I put the scissors in, everything slides down a little bit then stops. Because the magnet isn't strong enough, it works better on the side of the fridge rather than on the door where opening/closing the door constantly jars it. **The scissors have many functions:
They come apart & can be used separately for slicing. At the top of one handle is a bottle opener. The top of the other handle can be used as a screw driver. With the blades joined you can open jar lids or crack nuts between the handles. One blade doubles as a vegetable peeler. The other blade's serrated edge can be used to scale fish."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Excellent product - my second. I love the look and feel of this pillow.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I, too, have been a DeWalt user for many years, having moved to their brand when I felt the Makita line went substandard.  After deciding to move up to an 18 volt product, I spent months conducting research, going to wood shows, and actually trying out numerous lithium ion and non-litium ion 18 volt tools.  My final choice was this kit.  Here are some of the reasons why:

Batteries:  18 volt lithium ion.  Fantastic idea to go with lithium ion.  The charge lasts longer and will not dissipate over time.  In addition, the battery design (outer housing) is smart.  I do not need to click two buttons on the side to disengage the battery from any of the tools.  I simply need to click the one button on the front of the battery and the battery slides out.  Because my hands are small, this makes all the difference in the world.

Drill Driver - For my hands, this was the most ergonomically correct grip I found.  This drill feels great, does not fatigue my hands after many hours of use, and does not weigh as much as the competition.  The 18 volt battery does not add as much weight as I thought it would, and the tool balances in my hand perfectly.  In addition, I didn't think I would like having LED's built into the drill, but I really do like the additional light when I am working.  Excellent drill all around.

Recip Saw - Again, excellent feel and power.  I have used this saw to cut through a variety of materials without any lag.  The one button saw change also adds a nice touch.  Grip and balance are excellent, with the battery adding the perfect amount of counterweight to the entire setup.

As I mentioned earlier, I looked at all of the kits available.  For the price and the product you receive, I don't think you could find a better value for your money than this kit."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"The purple color was true to picture, with the colors of the original bottle opener.  The colors are so bright and vibrant.  I also love the fact that the white color is truly purple.  It is a lovely addition to the decor.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one to become a complete mess."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I was just looking at space heaters and am happy to have this one. The footprint is nice and slim, so the heater can easily be tucked away when not in use. You can rest it directly on the floor or mount it on the wall. I opted for a wall mount and found the included mounting diagram to be helpful in drilling the included brackets. I actually mounted mine sideways and it feels rock solid on the wall. The buttons feel a little tight, and I question their longevity with repeat use, however, they seem to be of nice quality so it should be fine. There's a filter on the back that can be removed for cleaning, but I can tell already it'll be a pain to get to, given the unit is mounted to the wall. As far as heating, the unit feels a little drafty, but that's how these ones are designed. I much prefer the ones that just emanate heat rather than blowing it with a fan.  Overall, this one is nice and seems to be priced right given the quality build."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I love my Capresso  frother! It's become a favorite little noise in the morning. While my coffee brews, my milk or cashew nut or almond milk happily swirls away into a nice hot froth. Nice and compact, so does not take up a lot of counter space. Whole milk froths better than 2% or non fat. Unsweetened almond milk does not froth, needs to be the sweetened kind and it will get a nice head of frother. UNsweetened cashew milk WILL froth a little."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I used the longer version to install a fairly heavy 60' wide headboard (about 50 lbs.) and even though the product feels very light-weight, it seems to hold the headboard securely and I have no concern about it falling.  It was easy to install, the included level was spot on (I double-checked it with my own longer level, and the multiple drilled holes made it easy to ensure that it was screwed into two studs.

The only concern I have is that in an earthquake, there's nothing to prevent the headboard from being dislodged from the track and landing on my head.  In a high-traffic area or with active children running around, you'd have the same risk of the item being jostled enough to do the same thing.  I've installed a shelf directly above the headboard, screwed into both the headboard and the wall, to prevent that, and if you didn't want to do that you could probably install braces above or below the hanging item to prevent upward movement.  But this problem is true of most methods of hanging heavy items on the wall, so it shouldn't be considered a defect in the product.

It also has a nice locking mechanism to prevent the blades from exposure and unwanted cutting.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I had a Tekton mini bolt cutter, but this is much better.  The HK Porter has a maximum opening of nearly 1/2"" (7/16ths of an inch at the very top of the V opening) which means it opens more than twice as wide as the Tekton.  There is enough strength to cut through framing nails (.131"" or thereabouts) with little difficulty; wood screws cut like butter.  Also, while the Tekton has a flip-up wire catch at the bottom to hold the tool closed, the HKP has a slightly clumsy but perfectly effective thumb catch at the top, just below the cutter head - it works from either side, making the tool left- as well as right-handed.

The tool has a very comfortable soft plastic grip.  It feels solid and works effectively.  It does lack the Tekton's limiter screw.  It would not cut the only bolt I tried it on (neither does the Tekton), but scored it enough to guide an oscillating blade."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,This is a fine tool that does more than you expect. When sold with the carrying case and multiple discs it is an exceptional value. It allows you to work in tight places and feels good in your hand. Very stable and solid. Surprisingly powerful for such a compact tool. The controls feel natural and intuitive. Using it does not tire you out.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"These cups are huge and beautiful.  Unfortunately when I got my package, there was an ominous rattling in the box.  There is very little packing between the cups and apparently an impact had shattered one completely, shattered one's handle beyond repair and snapped another handle off which was able to be reattached with just a little gap missing. Only the blue cup survived.

Sadly, I really love the cup that survived, so I miss the ones that didn't make it.  The mugs are nice and big, perfect for serving desserts, soups or cereals out of.  It doesn't seem to be the highest quality ceramic mug, but it is decent.  It seems homey and casual enough to use everyday, and survives the dishwasher fine.

I'm sure Amazon would replace any mugs destroyed in transit, but I with a little more care in packaging had been used to ensure that they would arrive intact.  Otherwise, they are beautiful."

I had to replace a couple of the containers because the cover was breaking off.

The containers are in good condition, they are well made and look good.

They are a bit smaller than I expected and I would not be able to fit a full set into the container.

They are not as sturdy as I thought they would be, but they will not break if I get too much use out of them.

I would not recommend them.I ordered these to help with my baking that needed some baking powder in it.  I love the color and the color is perfect.  The only issue is that I only used one of the top caps.  I wish I had purchased the other one for my bed.  I wish the top caps had a little bit more space to hold the top of the baking.  I will probably buy a different one.  They are also great for making cookies or cookies that I don't need to bake in the oven.Great, very strong, and I like that it holds a lot of items.  I have a ton of items in my closet, and I have a lot of items in the freezer.  These work great for that.This is a good quality and works well. It comes with a nice cover and a handy timer. The only thing I am a little concerned about is the size of the cover. I put it on my countertop, and it's way too small for the little pillows. I think this is a good size for the room. It would be perfect for the kitchen, but not for the bedroom."

The only reason I gave it four stars is that it's a bit small, but if you're a lot smaller than that, it's not really a problem. If you're going to use it for a lot of things, it's a good size for them.

I'm very happy with this purchase. I just wish there was a way to go by the size of the cord when opening the bag, it's a little too small for my small hands. I'm not sure how long it would hold up to it's use. I haven't used it at all. I'm not sure how long it would hold up to the use of my large hands.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Ok, a few hours earlier, I reviewed a fan that even had a speaker in it. It really didn't blow much air. So, I get home earlier today and this fan had arrived. So, i charged it all day. I didn't have much in the way of expectations. It doesn't have as many features. Let's see what features it does have, according to the manufacturer...

Features
1X Handheld palm sized portable fan, powered by a rechargeable battery (included) or by the provided micro USB charging cable via computer/notebook, car charger, power bank, 5V wall USB charger, 5v solar charger etc.
3 adjustable speeds plus an LED light on the side, perfect seaming, made of top quality ABS
Highly efficient yet practically quiet; powerful yet energy saving, perfect for your office, dorm, home etc.
Please make sure the battery is placed correctly inside the slot before you turn on the fan.
Best cooling effects can be achieved when you hold it in your hand. Great fan for when you are out and about.

I got home from work tonight and as soon as I saw the fan, I went straight for it. As soon as I turned it on, I immediately felt more are than the other fan on high. It had two more higher settings! And it also has a light, so if your power goes out, you have a fan AND a flashlight! I love this thing already! Five stars for this little powerhouse of a fan! Oh, and it's cheap too! The other fan was $30!

It's heavy duty and well made-should last for years.

It's not perfect, though. The handles are bulkier than the Swing-Away. And, it doesn't work very well on flat aluminum cans-the kind that kipper snacks come in (I ended up crushing one of these cans in attempting to open it-I had a real mess).

For my needs this is exactly what I was looking for."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"The mattress showed up on the doorstep in a box approximately 5 feet tall, and weighing around 50 lbs. Possible to move alone, but way better with a helper.

We opened one side of the box and slid the mattress onto our box spring. So surprised to find it vacuum sealed for maximum flatness! (Very helpful when putting it into position.)

The mattress started growing to size as soon as the plastic was cut, so I recommend having a plan to discard the plastic and to make sure the top and head/foot of the mattress are in their proper positions. Out of curiosity, we laid on it within 10 minutes of ""inflation"" and were already pleased with the amount of ""squish"", comfort, and support.

Upon returning from dinner, the bed was at it's advertised 10 inch mark and ready for another test. The ""sink"" was far more dramatic than the first go. Compared to other memory foam mattresses, the ""sink"" on this one is incredibly snug and articulate. Indentations were even made by the weight of my elbows.

Lumbar support is excellent. Head and neck support is very comfortable. I could probably sleep on this thing without a pillow.

It may be too squishy or soft for those who like a firmer bed, but time will tell and we may adjust. Also, fresh out of the box, it has an odd paint odor to it, so an open window and/or a fan is suggested.

In regards to the ""gel-infused cooling layer"", I admit that I was skeptical. Though, on this very hot day, I surprisingly have yet to sweat while lying on the bed. Consider me impressed.

I love this light. It works well and seems to last for quite a while. It's very bright. It's very easy to install. The light is very small, which is why I put it in a larger light box.

I'm disabled so the ease of use is perfect for my needs. When my nephew saw this dolly, he loved it. So I bought one for him to use when he transports his wares to comic/anime conventions.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"These batteries are great! They last longer and provide more power than the original ones ever did.  I bought two because I need 20+ minutes sometimes to get a job done.  When new,  the original batteries might have made 15 minutes.  Of late,  I wasn't getting 5. So far,  I've never needed to switch out these new batteries to complete a job.  What took me so long to get a decent battery?"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I was very pleased with the value of this trimmer.  It ran great right out of the box.  My only issue is that there isn't much line included, and it came loose one time and I had to stop to remove and reassemble the entire bobbin.  I found the forward loop handle to be a bit too small to easily balance and manuver the head, especially since a sholder/neck strap was not included.  After some practice, I got the hang of it, but I will be looking for a strap to add.

The Expand-It system promises to make this even more of a great value.

No issues with the reconditioned product, simply came in a brown box and has a ""RECON"" stamp in the plastic.

UPDATE:  After about 4 years of normal use and standard maintenance, this trimmer finally died on me.  Everything was in good working order, but for some reason the piston seized up and the connecting rod broke.  The oil was topped off and fresh, there were no indications of a pending failure.  I am really disappointed, but can't really complain.  I have since gone back to a 2-stroke trimmer because ultimately, for the application, the 4-stroke is a bad idea."

After my first year with these I have bought more of them and I don't even use the metal ones anymore. I love the contained system, I don't get any bugs in my system. i do get some leaks around them but very little and I think that is more related to my learning curve then anything. i have used them for two years now with out a problem, they are holding up fine."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"I have had this saw for a number of years. I am primarily a carpenter but dabble in a lot of crafts for the sake of expediency and simply out of acquiring a skill in a variety of types of work.  If I had it to do over again I would not buy a bridge-type saw. The concept seems good but in reality, the design just doesn't provide the kind of sawing control needed to cut tile accurately.  The blade cannot be moved smoothly across tile the way it can on saws where the blade remains fixed and the bed holding the material moves INTO the blade.

The slated fixed aluminum base also creates a rather slippery platform for wet tile. Some type of backstop to prevent the material from shifting is needed and the inferior design and cheaply built T-square provided just isn't adequate.  It simply does not provide adequate control of the cutting process.

You would think that the extended length of the box like construction would provide ample space for long cuts on larger tiles but the bridge arms are inevitably in the way of most cutsforget doing diagonal cuts on larger tiles.

Besides an inferior design, the unit is cheaply made with poor welds and rough finishes that do not hold up well. The water reservoir and pump produces a sloppy mess that can be generally be avoided with other style saws.  The motor is also a bit underpowered but nonetheless has continued to run with regular use.

Don't let the quirky design lure you in. Look to more basic type tile saws."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Love this ladder.  You are able to get close to the area you are working on.  I recently used it to hang some drapes in my living room.  You can either have the ladder open with a four legs and be close to the work area or you can lean the ladder against the wall and use just as safely as you would with all four legs.  An additional feature is the middle section on the work top allows you to lean the ladder against a corner.  I added some photos of the ladder below.  I do recommend this ladder for personal or professional use.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"I hadn't used a strop before and decided to see what this could do on my fixed blade knives.  I was really surprised.  You can take a knife that's sort of sharp and get it to the next level with this strop.  I just wouldn't have predicted it.  So in terms of performance, I'd rate this at least a 4 star, maybe 5.  Why only 3 stars?  This is WAY overpriced.  You can get double sided, quality strops for about $20 and the green compound is like $5 for a huge block of the stuff.  Yes it takes some effort to ""load"" the leather, but if you look on youtube you'll find all kinds of tricks to make that work.  This strop should cost about $25.  Didn't realize that at the time I bought it.  So, nice effective strop, but way too expensive."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"We try to eat a lot less meat and we still use this several times a week. It's not just for cooking meat. Soups, roasts, dry beans, yogurt, veggies, you name it. It does them perfectly.

I have always struggled with tough pot roast, even in a slow cooker. I was starting to wonder if what I consider tender and what other people consider tender were two very different things! I made one in the Instant Pot in 70 minutes and it was the most tender, flavorful roast I have ever had.

I make dairy and non-dairy yogurt in it and it turns out perfectly. (Soy milk is the only dairy alternative I've had luck with, not almond or coconut.)

I now make dry beans in it and love them. So stinking easy to press a button, walk away, and be reminded a short time later. We are now eating a lot more rice and beans as a family and my grocery bill is $100 less now.

I love the stainless steel inner pot. I've never owned stainless steel before but now I'm hooked. It cleans fairly easily and I can wash it in the dish washer.

I love that I can truly make things all in one pot. I saute the onions or bacon in the pot, then dump everything else in, pressure cook, then if need be I add other ingredients and simmer to thicken whatever I've made. The pot is also deep enough that it doesn't splatter. I bought a whole chicken on sale and was able to make the equivalent of a rotisserie chicken for $4.

I've only made rice in it once and wasn't as satisfied with the results as my aroma rice cooker but I honestly haven't tried all the different combinations of water ratios, cooking times, and pressure releases. For now it's just easier to stick with my fuzzy logic aroma cooker."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"We bought the matching Delta Soap Dispenser,RP71543RB, to the Cassidy High Rise Pull Down kitchen faucet - 9197-RB-DST.  Also bought the matching Dishwasher Air Gap.

The rubbed bronze finish was excellent and matched the Cassidy faucet.  The quality of construction was excellent.  The push down handle did not look cheap and feels like it will hold up to use.  The shape and size was really very good.  The bottle is very large, holds 10 ounces and can be filled from the top by simply removing the top push down handle.  Hint:  Use the funnel and no drops go on the counter top.  Instructions are on the back of the box.

Installation was quick and easy.

The shape of the base of the soap dispenser is very nice and the pinata was excellent.  The appearance is excellent and it looks great with the Cassidy faucet.  It doesn't look cheap like a lot of soap dispensers.  It's also considerably cheaper than a Moen soap dispenser.

However, after we took it outside to use it on a tire....it didn't work. It couldn't pump it up. It says not to let it run more than 10 minutes.

They're also capable of grabbing huge things, which can be really useful. They are definitely more expensive than other similar pliers, but they're also better made. I use them while working on cars all the time. The teeth on these pliers make them ideal for grabbing radiator hoses and coaxing them off barb fittings. Breaking old, stubborn hoses off radiators can be a huge pain and these pliers make that job much much easier. I have at least one of every size Cobra that Knipex makes from the really tiny to the comically large.

I am currently trying to contact the Sporting Goods place that sells these through Amazon to try to resolve. Turns out I got them here on Amazon, and the ones I got are very cheaply made, very poor manufacturing and you can't reach the company that makes them, so I would not recommend.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,I purchased the MM 520 because it seemed like a reputable company one year ago.  I was so wrong.  from the day of purchase nothing but problems.  This things been out of commission over 8 months out of a year I had it.  Every time I call them they make you test everything.  It's a good thing I know how to use an electric meter and have one around. After going through loops every single time they want the board sent back to them.  On the phone they tell you they will get one sent back to me in 5 days but it always takes about a month. Their constant excuses is they are under staffed.....  last time I had issue was due to constant beeping.  They wanted me to send back the unit back to get me another master board. well they sent me one but it did not work.  Then they wanted me to send them the arm and the board which I did.  Called them after three weeks of waiting and they tell me there is no board that came with the arm.  WHAT??????  So finally got it back after two months and it had a slave board instead of the master board.  that's not all. I get a package from them about a month ago with someone else control board and battery.  I have never dealt with such unknowledgeable support and disorganized company in my life.  What a joke.  DO NOT buy this product or any other product from this company.  Unless you enjoy paying over a grand for the product and accessories so you can open the gate by hand 70% of the time.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,I actually LOVED it when it worked. Unfortunately it quit after two months of occasional use. I didn't use it every day but probably 10 times in a two month period and then it just quit. It wouldn't do anything at all. Very disappointing.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"Beautiful and soft
Ordered king size and it arrived with a very thick blanket."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,These take up the entire room. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the bottom on top. The plastic part is also hard to put on the sides. I have had this product for about a year now. It is very well made and it holds a lot of things. It is very easy to store and I can use it on my counter top. I will say that I have to be careful with it as it is very fragile.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"When I'm seriously tired, this coffee machine infuriates me. Because if I""m tired I forget how particular it is about how you line up the basket. Then I have a hot water  with coffee grounds mess all over my counter top and I have to figure out how to clean that when all I want to do is sit down and drink coffee . Then I use more 4 letter words. Aimed directly at the makers of this piece of crap. I am going to buy a replacement coffee machine and this one is not broken. I have never done that before. I usually just rough it and pray the inferior product just breaks.  But I hate this coffee maker so much. Its like some kind of evil torturing device for the really tired. I'll give it 2 stars instead of one only because it does actually make decent coffee if you line up the coffee basket properly.

And to the person who found my original review of this unhelpful...I WAS TIRED WHEN I WROTE THAT!! forgive me!!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Actually, with this electronic headset for hearing protection, I'm able to hear everything going on around me. Nice feature to be able to adjust the volume setting you're comfortable with & no matter how high the setting is, you'll appreciate the noise cancellation when your shooting your firearms. The design is practical & comfortable. I've had these on for hours with no discomfort or irritation. If you're in a pinch for space to put these, they fold in to a very manageable size that can easily be placed in your range bag. One thing to note: you'll discover that placing the battery on each side of the headset is a little challenging. By that I mean you have to be a little forceful to pry the cushioned ear piece from the plastic headphone. Once you do the first one the second will be much easier. Other than that little bump in the road, this is a terrific product that I would highly recommend to interested parties."

I own higher dollar stones like the Naniwa Choseras and their specialty stones but this King 1K and the King 6k S-1 stones are all Ive been using. They are very inexpensive and work superb. I wish I would have bought these King stones at first rather then thinking I needed to spend the high price on the expensive stones. I don't even use them anymore because these kings work so well.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"I got this free for my wife and she loves it. If you have a house with a flood protection system, you will need to get the TELUSCO 4-inch flood protection system. It will cost $6. 50 for the $5. 99 version. I used it to install the Flood Protection System and it works great. I've had it installed for a few months now and it seems to be working fine."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Ordered it from Amazon on Nov. 15 and it arrived promptly on Nov. 20 in a nice box with the item in excellent condition!  I've owned the Makita BO5010 (non-variable) for several years and I love it.  The fit and finish on the BO5012 is just as nice and it feels much lighter and better balanced than my new variable Porter Cable (which I'm going to sell to a friend ASAP).  I was undecided between this unit and the highly rated Bosch variable, but after lifting the Bosch up, I felt it was also too bulky for me.  Overal an excellent choice for me, sands extremely smooth and picks up most of the dust without the vacuum attached."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Beautiful looking faucet with great features and works perfectly. Installation was a snap, really easy because it was well designed to ease installation. The pullout sprayer works great and I really like having a switch for stream or spray that remains set whether the water is on or not. Some faucets require water flowing to change from stream to spray. The magnetic spray head works really well to hold the spray head in place and not sagging. Overall I cannot find anything that I don't like about this faucet and soap dispenser."

I found the opening to be much smaller than anticipated.  I purchased this based on the reviews that it would cut a sweet potatoes.  I would not recommend this product if you looking to cut a sweet potatoe. The suction to keep it in place did not work and it was uncomfortably placed.  The sweet potatoes when I finally got it to cut went flying out of the contraption.  In the video you see the suction come back up so I have to hold it down.  Then you see how much pressure it takes me to get the sweet potato though and it never makes it the last little bit so everything go flying out over and into the sink.  Ugh."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,These are really a good thing to have when wood carving or whittling. Good purchase. Would use seller again.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Do not over tighten screws it will go right through the plastic.  I recommend finding at least one stud to hit it with drywall screws.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,It did a pretty good job on my tile and hardwood floors.  Very easy to changes the brushes and fill and empty water containers. It was a little heavier than I thought it would be though.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,These are the best.  I have bought many.  Batteries last about 3 months with everyday use.  Good brightness. You will not be disapointed!
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Good rip fence. It actually comes with three thumbscrews. The new model Milwaukee saw uses one thumbscrew, & the old model uses two, so all three are included. I have owned both models, and the one with two thumbscrews works better. The new model I have now has the one thumbscrew that goes in at an angle & tends to turn the rip fence at an angle when tightened. It still works good, the rip fence is great, but the saw itself could have been designed better."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,Hard to use because it will scrape the wall if you don't keep it at a perfect angle to the wall.

The Makita DeWalt 12 volt batteries are a good choice for home use.I bought this for a friend who has a house, and he uses it all the time. He loves it and wants it for his shop.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"After reading every review on deep fryers I could find, I finally decided on this one.  It has been great and I couldn't ask for anything better or more easy to use.

I put it on my cooktop and let my big hood suck away any odors.  It heats up quickly and the food has always come out great.  We made donuts after cooking shrimp and halibut with no cross-odors or tastes!  My family only tolerates fish, so this was greatly appreciated.

Cleanup is easy also.  After waiting for the oil to cool, the pan, lid and rack can go into the dishwasher.  Only the heating element has to be cleaned by hand and it is quite easy.  The oil can be used many times without problems and so it is more economical to use than I originally thought it would be.

I would recommend this with no caveats."

They are very bright and very easy to use. They are very heavy and a good value for the price. I bought this for a friend who has a house in which he uses a lot of tools. He has it and he loves it. He was a little skeptical at first, but since it was a must for him and was a huge deal for him he has bought it for him for a few years. He also loves it. It is made of metal and has a plastic base. It is very sturdy and well made. It has a very nice grip to it, and the plastic is a nice touch. It is made of nickel and has a soft rubber coating to it. It is very well made, and very easy to use. It is easy to set up and work with. It is very sturdy and it is easy to adjust. It does not come with a hook, and it is a small plastic hook, so if you are going to hook it up you will need a small hook, but for most people this is not a problem.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"Great revues but no one mentioned the fact that it does not come with any needed accessories!  No hose (which costs about $22 at local store) and nothing for it to hang from or connect it to the shower pipe (which costs about $11 at store).  What?!  So, this no frills shower head ends up costing over $60 (nearly $70) when all is said and done.  No thanks...sending it back.  I'll  go get an all in one Delta or whatever."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Works good.  Haven't tested with heavy loads, but for simple home stuff like lamps and chargers, it splits the 120 A/C current for 2 devices concurrently.  Wife thinks the black cords are bulky, so they aren't aesthetically charming, but at least we have extra outlets behind furniture.  Note to mfgr: try to make these in white and with thinner cables (18-20 awg).
  ALSO I really wanted to buy these as a 3-1 cord.  Please also make this as 3 in 1 cord.  I.e., runs 3 A/C outlets from 1 wall socket.  There already is a maker for the 4 in 1 cord, but only Stanley makes a WAY overpriced 3 in 1 cord."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,I inherited a 6 gallon compressor and a couple of air houses from a family member.  I'm guessing they are about 10 year old.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I've had this unit installed for about 4 months now at I have been very pleased.  I have it controlling a Trane XL80 Dual-Stage Gas Furnace w/ Trane XR16 A/C Slim-line Unit.  Dual Stage Furnace works as designed even though this thermostat is manufactured by Honeywell (and is a lot cheaper than the Trane branded thermostats).  Very happy with this Honeywell unit and like the various customization features it offers me.  FYI, the Wi-Fi feature works as they all do; i.e., your smart phone connects to your home wi-fi connection, which then connects to Honeywell's server via the internet, with the Honeywell server then sending your commands back to your home wi-fi connection via the internet, which then communicates directly with the thermostat unit.  Thus, your smartphone interacts with Honeywell's off-site server and not directly within-your-house with your thermostat unit."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,Excellent unit. Much better than the original. Charges quickly and efficiently.  Glad I found this unit online. So far so good
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Easy to install.  Nice finish.  Smooth surface for towels.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,Perfect for straining whole boiled eggs.  It's a good idea to make a small hole in the bottom of the bowl to hold the egg and then put a couple of screws in it to secure it to the bowl.  I would suggest using some thin nylon to secure the holes. 
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"I purchased this in blue to put under my dining room table to protect the wood floors. While I don't have a problem with the quality so far, there is this awful stench coming from the rug. It smells like chemicals. I thought the smell would dissipate after a few days.. I was wrong. Also, if you have pets you can see just about every bit of hair on it. I wished I wouldn't of purchased this but it's too late. Not absolutely horrible- just not for me.

***UPDATE 6/1/16***
I am truly regretting this rug especially in this color!! . Every little speck of dust and animal hair and shows up and it always looks dirty even after I vacuum it. I have a great vacuum so I definitly know that's not the problem."

I had been saving up money to buy fancy curtains but came across these and decided that, for the price, I couldn't go wrong. The length I wanted (91 inches) wasn't in stock so I got these longer, 108 inch ones. WOW- they look just like beautiful raw silk and they are such a beautiful color. The length wasn't even too bad but I decided to use some hem tape so they just break about 1-2 inches on the floor. They were wrinkly from being packaged up so I ironed them a little, which was very easy. I will definitely be buying more curtains like these in the future!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"This was my second waring blender. Previously, I had one that was a bit shorter. This one can fit a lot of liquid, but apparently it is not meant for crushing ice. Huh? It is a bar blender. What is it for then? I only found this out because when my husband accidentally broke ours by blending a few cubes of ice (along with milk, bananas, yogurt), we contacted waring to see if it was under warranty and if it could be replaced. The blender would turn on but the blade didn't seem to be spinning anymore. Waring asked if we had used ice in the blender ""because it wasn't designed to crush ice."" We explained that t had, but only a small amount. Long story short, waring offered a once in a blue moon replacement blender top, but ""just this time."" Two to 3 weeks later it had still not arrived. My husband contacted the lady to ask her if she had shipped the replacement, because we really just wanted to know if we needed to buy a new blender so we could make smoothies in the mornings again. The replacement blender is $60-100, depending on where you buy it, so yeah we were waiting for the free one. The blender finally arrived, after hassling the lady again. I stuck my hand in the box and hundreds of shard of glass sliced into my skin. So, that was nice. The blender had been barely bubble wrapped. We didn't bother requesting a new one, and bought an entirely different blender instead. We bought the Farberware 4-speed  digital blender for $40.00 and have been happilly blending ever since. I used to be a blender snob, but unless you are going to fork over the money for a BlendTec or Vitamix, or something along those lines, there is really no point to spend a lot. I'm sorry but if a waring blender can't make a semi-frozen smoothie, what can it do? Puree soups?"

This is my first bagless system and I really thought I would hate it but it empties out very easy & goes right back on the system with no problem.

You simply attach one to each corner of the picture, remove the stickers on the back and then place on the desired spot on your wall and apply pressure for a few minutes. Be sure to have your wall marked out beforehand to ensure the picture doesnt go on wonky
For something not too heavy like a regular picture, these work like a dream, but the heavier you go, the more strain you will be placing on the stickers and their glue, so these are not suitable for large heavy glass or wooden frames, which will probably end up falling to the ground."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This product is made of great quality.
The ice bowl is made of a heavy plastic and is great. The mold it was made from is of great quality, there wasn't any extra plastic around the bowl or any flaws that I could see. I was a little worried that it would leak but it does not and works very well to hold the ice to keep your dip chilled.
The metal bowl that goes on top/ in the bottom piece is made of great quality as well, it is metal so it will keep your dip cold for longer which is a great design. The metal bowl will keep your dip nice and cold as long as you need it too and just make sure that you keep ice in the bottom part.
So not only is this a great functioning product, but this works very well and looks elegant! I have had many compliments on this serving dish and I have referred many people to this bowl, I am over all satisfied with this product and this is just great and I couldn't be happier with this product. I can't wait to purchase a few more to give out for christmas gifts.
I did receive this product for free to test and share my honest and fair opinion. Other experiences may vary."

To be truthful I still prefer it over the wave; however, there are times when I have gotten beans and they taste significantly better on the Wave, usually beans from South America. The only real gripe with this pourover method is the filters. At the mercy of these pricey things. I say this because there have been a couple times where I accidentally overpour with my kettle when preheating the dripper/prewetting the filter. What happens with overpour is sometimes the weight of the water will cause creases in the filter and mess up the distribution of the water. You end up with a less tasty cup."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"i have been using this little juicer on a daily basis, sometimes with lime or lemon, but most times with oranges.  it is solid build and easy to use.  however i could think of few improvements (hence the 4 stars rating):

 - the holes can be made larger.  right now a lot of the holds are covered by the pulp after only juicing half orange so frequent cleaning is needed (i also drink the pulp)
 - the bottom bowl can be made slightly larger, the top bowl is a good side but it can not be used to catch the juice

anyway, i would recommend it to people with some wrist power b/c you have to push it down and twist."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"I came across this kit and it was an instant hit.  I had a small piece of wood (about 8"") and I needed a small bit of plastic to cover it up.  I used a little bit of paint on it and it was as smooth as it could get.  I was able to get it to fit in the wall.  It is a little heavier than I expected but it does hold up well.  The only negative I have is that I had to cut it to fit into the wall, so I would have to get another piece of plastic to cover it up.  I am happy with it so far.I've used this one to get around a ceiling fan on my garage. I don't know if it's the best or not, but it's a great little light.

The baking time is not as slow as I wanted it to be. I got a second one for my daughter to use when she's in her first year. It's a great product. Love the design of this pan. We use it on our sink and it's really easy to clean. It is a little pricey for a single pan, but it is a great product for the price. I love that it has a removable lid so you can keep your fingers from scratching the pan. It is a little bit pricey for something that we purchased at the grocery store.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Ordered this to frost my bathroom window. Followed directions to a T and the results were very impressive. There is no way to tell from sight that the windows were treated with a spray, no streaks, no thin coated areas of the glass. As long as you use it per the instructions it will work as intended. Now for the bad part. As I was putting on the final coat of the spray it started to sputter. There is about half the can left so no reason for it to seem ""out of gas"". Noticed an accumulation of the  spray in liquid form around the nozzle which seems to be causing the sputtering. If I can get the nozzle to work without sputtering then I can use it to frost one more window. I will try to clean it with warm water see if the nozzle will clean up for use, but if anyone has other suggestions I am open to it. Product would have gotten a 4 or 5 star rating if it wasn't for the sputtering with half the can left.

Edited to give additional star issue with nozzle was resolved :)"

I guess that a good deal of torque is applied to the single nut and bolt holding it in place, and it loosens easily, at least when installed without Locktite as my plumber did.  It's almost impossible to get at this nut.  I could feel it in order to hand-tighten it blindly, but I couldn't get it secured.  I thought getting a wrench on it without a special plumber's faucet tool would be impossible.  I was therefore nearly ready to give up and request a service call, that surely would have cost $100, when I saw this product.  It came in 2 days, and my faucet was secured rigidly (pun intended, sorry) in 2.01 days -- a minor miracle from my desperate perspective.
I wish it had multiple inserts for different size nuts because if they're mounted flush, I don't see how it could reach the smaller sizes, as designed with the smaller-sized wrenches nested within and below the largest.  That didn't matter in my case, but it would limit the usefulness somewhat under some circumstances.
Other reviews would lead one to believe that it's too flimsy to be useful, and that's certainly UNtrue.  The construction is plenty strong enough for hand-tightening or loosening, which is all it's designed for and which should almost always be sufficient.  I can see how you might crack or break it if you tried to turn the lower end with a pipe wrench.  The slot, which is the genius-inspired part of this tool, could allow it to deform under that kind of torque, but it's not designed for that use.

Highly recommended; an inexpensive solution to potentially expensive home-maintenance problems."

It has been two years and the switch is still working great.

Update:
I wrote an email to Leviton's complaint department after my switch stopped working and after reading all of the negative reviews.  The next day a nice lady called me and told me that they did have a manufacturing quality problem with these but corrected the problem over a year ago so I must have received old stock from the store that was never shipped back.  She said she would ship me a replacement and not to worry about returning the defective one.  The GFCI switch arived a few days later and has been working great since.  I will be sure to come back and update this review if the switch fails again.  Thank you Leviton for doing the right thing.
By the way don't bother calling the ""technical service number"", they can only tell you to send the product into their warranty center.  Write them an email at info@leviton.com

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"I purchased this right before Christmas. It's a good size and looks great in my kitchen. The top is a nice, solid piece of wood and the cover is very sturdy. It is hard to get the carpet out of the car if you don't have a lot of space. I have a few of them in the house and they are a little rough. I just put them in the car and it is nice and smooth. I would recommend this product for any home or business. I bought this as a gift for my son who loves to read. It was a gift for my son who was a little too young for that. It was a gift for his mother. She has it in her room and she likes it. It's a great little book opener. I have used it for about a month and it still works. I bought the perfect size for my son's bookshelf, and he loves it. He is going to be using it for his mother's bookshelf when he grows up. I have used it for a few years now and he is very happy with it. I would definitely recommend this product. I was looking for a nice, solid rug that was a little too large. This is exactly what I was looking for. I love that it has a lot of space, but it is not a huge amount. The quality is good. The colors are good, but the fabric is not thick enough to hold up against the sun. It is very hard to hold up against the sun. I would not recommend this rug."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a great heater for bedrooms or other small to medium rooms.  Shuts off when it reaches the desired temp.  The listed temp may not be exact, but you can adjust to your comfort."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I have teenage boys, 3 big dogs, and 2 cats.  I vacuum daily, and I'm hard on my vacuums.  This is my 3rd Hoover Wind Tunnel variation... and I like it the best, and the suction is fantastic, but it is heavy.  Heavy to carry, heavy to push.

THE GOOD:
+ Fabulous suction pulls up all the pet hair you didn't want to know you had.  ""Multi-cyclonic"" suction; previous model was ""Dual Cyclonic"".
+ 7 settings for carpet height.  The previous model (Wind Tunnel 2 Pet Plus) had 5. Not sure that you need 7 but I guess some houses do.
+ Retractable cord - same as the previous model but longer by 3'.  Love this.
+ Rinseable filter and ""one button"" cup emptying (more on this in The Bad).
+ A great hose which, like on the previous model, 'clicks' to pull out/put back so you know you've got it replaced correctly -- but this hose stretches 5' more (to 15').  Great for stairs and ceiling fans!
+ 3 onboard tools (+ standard telescoping wand)... I like that they stay ON.
+ Wider (15"") head.  This is good and bad in my opinion.  You can get big rooms done faster but it doesn't fit under some things.
+ Folding handle!  Great!  Now fits in the closet!

THE BAD:
- Not 'steerable' - though I didn't take off for this as it doesn't say it is
- HEAVY!  Heavy to push and to carry,
- ARGH.  I still hate the cup-emptying!  I don't know how to solve this but I'm not an engineer and presumably someone at Hoover is  It's true you just hold the cup over the trash and push one button BUT the door swings away as the dirt is falling out...meaning that the door gets covered in dirt and is awkward to clean off as it hangs, swinging and spreading gunk, over your trash.

BOTTOM LINE:
GREAT for pet houses, lots and lots of suction and conveniences... might be too heavy for an older person."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"We got this as an upgrade to our current Sentry Fire-Safe which is older (circa 2000), smaller, and doesn't have a water rating. At first feel, the dial felt a bit cheap and clunky as it didn't spin smoothly (it was like you could feel it catch every so often) but it didn't hamper the use of the safe at all. I'm not sure if I love or hate the clicking sounds as you rotate the dial (my last one was silent so am used to that). I hope to never worry about needing to unlock it in a perfectly quiet manner.

Regarding the keys, I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about--you don't NEED the keys to lock the safe. I locked mine just fine without the key: just close the safe, raise the lever, and spin the dial...and it's locked. The key just adds another layer of security--once you lock the safe with the dial, you use the key to turn the key-lock from Unlocked to Locked. But, thinking I might have missed something (after reading a few reviews) I just specifically went back to test it...and confirmed you do not need the key to securely lock the safe. Right now, my keys are locked in the safe and I can get in and out just fine.

I do like all the room in the safe, but would have liked a drawer (like the one that came with my other safe) or at least another shelf. I was also blessed with a super easy combination, so I'm thrilled with that.

Overall, a very nice safe for the price."

The problem is that plastics are so ubiquitous and cheap.  How do you replace them without - at the very least - going broke?

You watch prices on Amazon.  These are really small jars.  The set cost about three times as much as the same-sized disposables, which means that in two re-uses, they didn't owe me any money and after three, they were putting me ahead.  Yes, my kid has to remember to bring them home.  But they don't break easily, and, because I can microwave in them, they save on dishwashing, too.

This is not a top of the line model or and I wouldn't recommend it for heavy industrial use.  However, for home use or its intended use is light then this drill will work for you.  There is no need to spend lots of money on a professional model.

Everybody holds and uses the same tool differently.  I didn't really like the feel of the tool in my hand.  It just doesn't have a comfortable quality feel.  But then I prefer top of the line tools, they usually pay you back in useability, durability and quality of work.  But then this drill may be ok for you.

Some of you might be thinking ""it's just a piece of iron!"" but there are several small but key items that make this a better unit.

The metal seems nicer.  After cleaning them both, the lodge does seem shinier (if that's even possible) whereas my older unit started darkening after the first use.

Food and debris seem to come off easier with the Lodge though still a chore depending on what you cook.

The grill lines are wider and flatter than my other grill.  This makes cleaning easier and actually better grill marks on the food.

The grip at the end of the pan is also easier with the hole at the end of it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I purchased the Paula Deen steamer as a replacement for a Cuisinart steamer so I'll be comparing it to that.  Overall, the PD unit is pretty well made.  It's lightweight, but not thin walled.  The steamer fits very snug to the pot and does an admirable job letting condensed water seep through the holes.  I thought it did a better job of this then the Cuisinart unit.  This is probably due to the slightly larger steamer holes in this unit.

What I love most about this steamer is the rubber like wrapping of the handles and lid.  This keeps both the steamer and the lid cool enough to handle even when the pot has been boiling for a long time.  The Cuisinart did not have this and it's definitely a plus!  What's also better in the PD steamer is its resistance to staining; cleaning up is pretty easy.

What I don't like is what keeps this unit from getting 5 stars; the design of the base.  The base has a concave design, that is it's flat on the outside, but the metal depresses in towards the middle.  Why is that a problem?  Because this means the bottom doesn't get full contact with the ceramic stovetop that I use which means I spend more time waiting for water to boil, alot more time then the Cuisinart.  The PD unit has a copper plated bottom, which should mean a faster and more efficient heat transfer, but there's just not enough of the metal to make contact.  If you're using a gas stove, then this is irrelevant.  I'm guessing it was designed this way to save money by cutting material costs, but it will end up costing me more in the long run with a higher electric bill.  I would have gladly paid $5 more if the bottom were flat.

Overall I am happy with the purchase and would buy it again if I had to."

I got two and use them both several times throughout the week. They are a great size and do whatever job I throw at them. I am going to subtract 1 star (although I would only subratct .5 if half-stars were possible) because of the lids. It's not the fit, they fit fine, make a great seal and everything. The problem is with the attachment of the handle, which creates a big empty space above the glass in the center of the lid which traps all kinds of nastiness when you wash it in the dishwasher. It's not too much of pain to clean, but it does require unscrewing the handle and removing it completely, which is inconvenient. Fix that one issue and this would be a 5 star cheap pot easily.

When I finally ran out (who thinks about buying roller covers from Amazon) and couldn't find more at my local hardware store or home center, I bought others made by Purdy, Shur-Line and other well-known brands. None were ever as good as these. Purdy makes excellent paint brushes, but their rollers are merely OK and tend to make bubbles. Shur-Line makes excellent edgers but I never used any of their covers that didn't shed. Even Shur-Line's most expensive, top of the line ""premium select"" roller covers with their ""shed resistant technology"" shed badly. It's not the paint - I only buy Benjamin Moore and it's about $65 a gallon these days. They even tolerate cleaning well, if you want to you can get two or three uses out of a cover, but at this price why bother?

So after failing to find anything better, I bought another set of these Wooster covers from Amazon. Once again I am pleased. They hold paint well, don't leave bubbles, and absolutely do not shed. They're better than ones I've paid three times as much for."

  As suggested by another reviewer, I remove the tube after squeezing out an inch of adhesive and capping it. I store the tubes in the freezer in a vacuum sealed jar. Oh, and customer service by Franklin international is awesome.

Edit: After a using it for over a year, I am more aware of the limitations at home and in my beginners woodshop. It did not replace the pocket screws or the dowelmax, but complements them. It is unbelievable when I have 2 clean surfaces to be joined with enough flat surface area to hold. These are critical factors to remember.

The short set time for the 30 and 75 glues, though, means I have to get things aligned perfectly and very quickly--which as a novice woodworker is almost never! I just assembled a downdraft sanding box trying the 300 (5 min set time) which worked better for me on this kind of project. A more skilled person would use it for even more things. the biggest advantage is not having to wait overnight for the glue to set before moving on with a project. You are supposed to wait 24 hours before ""stressing"" it but it is strong enough to sand or whatever within 15 minutes.

 I just used a tube of the 75 (partially used) and a new tube of the 300 that had been stored in my freezer and almost 1 1/2 years past the expiration date. Very good product IMO."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I only got to use this once to remove water from my inflatable swimming pool. I used to use buckets to remove water. That was a pain in the a$$ and my back. I should have bought this pump much sooner. Very fast and quickly removed the water. The pool was about 4' below the street level, so I had to buy some PVC pipes and fittings at local hardware stores (wasn't expensive). I don't know about reliability but I love this for now."

Only 6"" long, so can fit in a back pocket OK.  Waterproof, although I haven't tested this feature.  Requires just one battery, which happens to be a size 18650 not found readily in the USA.  (But can be ordered with charger from Amazon.) I am really impressed with these CREE LED flashlights.  Forget about the 9-LED flashlights, and any old-model incandescent flashlights!

The LEDs shine in my eyes so I had to block them with masking tape (there's no on/off).

However, it is a little bulky and will make a great addition to the garage.  The only reason I didn't buy this is because of the extra storage space for the power.  I really like that it has a built-in fan and it has a cool white glow that doesn't fade or fade out.  It is a little difficult to find and you will have to get it for yourself.  It is a good value and I will be purchasing more of them.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Perfect size for hanging wreath, an easy to use and efficient way to make a small wreath"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Beautiful well-fitting faucet with well constructed hardware that operates smoothly.

First of all, you'll need a baseplate for most installations as the faucet does not come with one. This one:
Hansgrohe 14019001 Baseplate Kitchen Fits All, 10 Inch, Chrome
fits perfectly and the chrome matches the faucet. It costs around $40.

Next, the instructions are not particularly helpful for the non-plumbers among us. We hired a plumber for the installation. He was able to complete the task in about 80 minutes and charged $85. Note that if you have a separate spray attachment on your sink, you'll need to remove that and cap the hole.

The faucet has a switch on the top to go from smooth flow to spray, and the end of the faucet can be pulled out so that you can fill pots that are beside the sink using full flow. This is a significant feature.

This is not a small faucet, and it's just a little too tall for a small kitchen with a standard sized double sink. However, while it might look a little disproportionate, this improves the convenience factor since there will never be the possibility of something not fitting under the faucet and into the sink. It's a great faucet for larger sized sinks.

The handle works well to adjust both flow rate and temperature. Note that the faucet favors the right-handed person due to the position of the handle. No leaks, drips, or other annoyances. In use, the faucet is quiet. I'm very happy with the end result."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Practical joke? Since day one of using this thing, I keep imagining that the Candid Camera crew is hiding somewhere in my house. This morning, for instance... I placed my container on the center of the scale and zeroed it out. I measured out 40 grams of coffee. The container shifted maybe 1/2 inch and BOOM!, there were now 43 grams of coffee. I dumped all the coffee back into its bag to start over. Now, my container, which should be back at zero, weighed 17 grams. So I zeroed it out and tried again to measure out 40 grams of coffee - still a moving target, but I just went with it. I needed coffee. NOW. OK - on to measuring out 80 grams of water for the ""bloom"": I zeroed out my kettle and over-poured by about 10 grams, so I dumped out what I thought would be 10 grams of water.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Like the other reviewer, I just got this for the saw. Took advantage of the B&D promo ($10 off 50) which is the cost of the battery, charger, and the Saw alone, it is almost like the drill is just a bonus. I have own the string trimmer, hedge trimmer, blower, and a drill already and all use this great lithium 20v battery. For over two years, I used one battery for all this tools (still have 2 spare batteries plus another one and 2 chargers) I leave it on the charger and charge it after every uses.

One thing to notice is that the saw's blade is on the left and the motor on the right compare to my corded saw. This make sense if you are right handed so you can see what you're cutting but needs some getting use to.

UPDATE 10/16: Still loving everything about it, I hit the jackpot on this tooIs, thanks B&D--this 20v lithium is amazing! I finally decided to use the other charger and an extra battery for spare. I even bought a cheap Harbor Freight metal blade with 10mm arbor just to test and it worked really well for light metal cutting and just left the blade even when cutting wood."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Great size to take to the market; you can fill them up with a lot of produce without them becoming so heavy that the handles break. Great reusable option because they don't take up a ton of space as some other bags do.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Love this light. My neighbor was so impressed that he is buying some also. We like the spread of the flood light. We have many oak trees and the light disperses from the ground to well into the top of the tree and just as Impressive width wise. If you are looking for a spot beam this is not for you. But if you want to cove a wide area I do recommend this unit. I also like the output of the daylight version better than the warm white version.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"I bought this item in January last year and was quite pleased with the initial operation.  After 6 months or so, the motion detector sometimes did not turn on the lights and I had to walk through the dark kitchen to tap on the sensor to make it work.  Now the sensor never works and this is simply a manual switch.

I emailed Enerlite and their customer service rep said ""We don't usually get involved with our retailer's customers"", and told me to seek help from Amazon.  But of course it's been a year, so I guess that's all the help I am going to get.  The price is low, but not low enough to warrant buying another one year light switch, so goodbye Enerlite.  It's a shame because I really loved this switch in the beginning."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I don't know if this grill press is the best out there.  It's the first I've owned.  I can say it's been a pleasant surprise.  It's hefty, solid and has large surface area.  It works great to flatten bacon, and speeds up cooking burgers.  It fits well in a large pan or cast iron skillet.  Today I needed to press the water out of some tofu to fry it, and the grill press is perfect for it.  I think this is the kind of item that will have more and more uses as time goes by.

My only complaint, the handle is on a screw, and loosens from time-to-time, requiring a few turns of a screwdriver to tighten back up.  Otherwise I like and recommend this press."

It works great, and the size is perfect.  I used it for the kitchen and it works great.  I also have the old Schlage bulb that was replaced with this one.  This one has a nice white light.  I like that the bulb is longer than the old bulbs, which is nice.  I use this with my Dewalt lamp, which has a longer bulb and a smaller one.  The lamp has a nice white light, and the lamp is warm white. "
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Works great. Plenty sharp and sets at a good angle for grating. The whole thing comes apart to make basically two different graters. I haven't had a problem with feeling cheap or feeling like it will break like some reviewers have noted.
Overall I'm pretty darned happy with this little kitchen gadget."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"An inexpensive masonry saw that works fine.  It would be nice if it cut to a five-inch depth, since a ""four-inch slab"" is never exactly four inches deep.  For the price, though, it is terrific value.  It cuts quickly, and I experienced no kick-back.  You will need a 20-amp extension cord for most jobs -- I purchased one for $99 at a big box store.  The blade was included."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This works very well at grinding coffee grounds, and I would bet it would do just as well I grind and other things are listed in the instructions (peppercorns, seeds, and similar spices other than fresh herbs). It is very simple and straightforward to use. A few of the features that I especially appreciate our:

 - The fact that once you put in the settings (which are very simple), it automatically grinds for as long as needed and then automatically stops. The grinder I replaced did not do this, so it always left me wondering how long I should grind to make sure everything is round up while not grinding it to finally, and I often had to just open it up and put my finger around the grounds to check.

 - The locking mechanisms are very secure and I have confidence that it won't accidentally open, spilling the contents

 - That the part holding the blade and the coffee grounds is easily removable, Which will allow me to clean it easily with soap and water.

The only thing I've noticed that I wish was different was the cup number settings. The lowest setting is 4 cups, followed by 8, 10, 12. I wish there was a 6 cup setting, as I normally make 6 cups when I have company.

I saw a couple of comments about the cord and I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, arranging for the cord to simply wrap around the outside of the bottom of the unit would be simpler  that's what my old one did. That you actually pull down on the bottom to reveal the cord storage was not intuitive  I need to read the directions  but now that I understand how to access it, it seems like a nice way to keep the look streamlined.

I can't imagine liking another blade grinder any better than this one, making the sub-$20 price a great value."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"The bar does not fit into the two ends snuggly.  This is I can live with since this is the only bar whose depth fits into the space I have available in my bathroom for a towel bar.  However, what I find rather inexcusable is that the towel bar does not come with wall anchors for the screws.  Given how little wall anchors cost, there was no reason to not include some with the packaging.  The screws were loose and the bar was in constant danger of falling down (and in fact did fall down a few times) until I went down to the local store and got some wall anchors for #8 screws for less that $1.50 for 4 anchors.  With the drywall anchors that I bought separately, the towel bar is a lot more secure now."

I have Prime, so it arrived quickly.  When I purchased this it was even less expensive than comparable thermometers at my local store.  I like this one because the dial is larger and easier to see.

I have made regular espresso and also Expresso Americano (add hot water to expresso) and they both turned out great.  Haven't used it on milk yet but I plan to.  I am very impressed by the company.  They clearly take pride in their product.  I told my mom about it and she was bummed that the price was higher than what I had paid. But I honestly think it is worth the price.  I am no expresso expert but definitely a coffee snob.  This makes a great cup and is fun to use.  I would recommend this item."

This was a replacement for a standard suction cup. I did not need a suction cup.

I do not recommend this suction cup at all. I have not used it yet, but I have used it a few times and it is well worth the money.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Works well. Twisting motion feels good, and energy is transferred smoothly from hammer to tool. As others have said a good measured blow works better than full boar any day. You'll still break the fastener loose, save your bits, and your fastener.

Bits that come with it are quality, but I recommend that a set of  Vim Tools IMPACT-8 Impact Quality S2 Bit Set - 8 Piece be purchased with it. Bits break, that's a part of life using an impact driver."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,This is a good thermometer.  I wish it were faster but I honestly haven't found one that was fast.  The probe it came with frayed after about a year.  The replacement probe is thinner and coated so it makes smaller holes and is fray-resistant.  As with any thermometer calibrating is a must.  Mine was off 3 degrees on the high side.  Ice water should be 32F and boiling water 212F.  Hold the CAL button for 5 seconds then use the arrow buttons to say how many degrees you want to adjust it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This hand blender works great.  Easy cleanup and easy storage since the blade portion (and shaft) disconnect from the motor for cleaning.  Having it break down into two pieces allows the blender to be stored easily in a drawer.

The adjustable power levels are great too.  However, I would sure appreciate a ""stay on"" button on the next model.

This blender is great for making those quick Whey Protein and fruit shakes!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,CG,"I purchased this on a whim to replace an old bulb I had.  It's been working great so far.  The only thing I can say is that it's great for hanging pictures or decorations.  It's a little pricey for a lamp but I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I have a few of them in the house and they are bright enough to see without being too bright.  I highly recommend it to anyone who needs an accurate, accurate, accurate light for their home or work.I bought this as a replacement for my old version of the LED bulb that was discontinued and replaced with this.  The replacement bulb is not as bright as the original, but still works great.  I also like the color temperature range and the fact that it's a 5W LED bulb.  It's very cool to be able to adjust the light output of this bulb, but not too bright.  I will probably get another one for a friend or family member who uses it.  The other bulb I have is a 5W LED, so I would recommend this bulb to anyone who"

When full it weighs like 40 pounds, so to be honest I don't pick it up by the top handle. But there are good grips on both ends. The boxes stack nicely. From looking at it, I don't think there would be much issue with carrying a 20-30 pound load by the top handle."

It is very comfortable, and it is light weight. I am very pleased with the design. I have a large family, and the fact that it is a little heavier than I expected is great. I have a few items that I am returning, but I am not sure if it is worth it for the price. I will probably order another one. I have a friend who has a lot of work to do on it, and she loves it! I am very pleased with this product. Very nice to have them for those times when you don't want to have to wash them all the time. I have used them for about a month now and still love them. I have not washed them yet, but I will. I will probably buy a couple of more of these at a later date. I have been using this for a few months now and I have used it more than once to create a new outdoor cafe/fiesta. It is very sturdy and easy to assemble. It is also easy to clean. I have not had a problem with the coffee tasting bad, but I do wish there was a way to protect it from the elements and not ruin it. The quality is good and the colors are wonderful. I am very happy with it. Works great, but not as good as I expected. I have been using it for a few months now and it is still holding up well. So I will keep it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Bed frames hold up a mattress, and usually, that is all they do.  This one is the first one I have ever owned that made the mattress feel more supportive, more flat, and all around better to sleep on.  And the mattress is a top of the line Royal Pedic. This frame is built like a military war machine but anyone of average intelligence can assemble it, without tools of any kind, in about ten minutes.  No matter how you interpret the instructions put the wheels on first.  To get them to seat in the plastic inserts you will need a hard ( tile, concrete, steel, etc.) surface and straight line pressure.  Once in the plastic insert the wheels will easily seat in the frame.  The center ""T"" will only fit one way.  Do not force it.  If you are doing it properly, it will drop right in.  Get the wheeled version and off-set the locking wheels at opposite ends and sides.  When it is time to clean under the frame, you will be glad those wheels are helping you move it.  Don't worry about the cost.  You will never have to buy another bed frame, no matter how long you live, and you will never find one that will support your mattress and you nearly as well as this one."

It had a chemical smell when I took it out of the package, but after I washed and dried it along with the shams, no more problem there.  And it washed up beautifully - no shrinkage at all. It is a very colorful and rich look for our guest bedroom. You could use just about any color of sheets with this and it will look great. I like having a quilt instead of my usual comforter sets because of the fact that it is easily washable at home - and if you have kids or pets, that is a good thing."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This Tea Tumbler is fantastic! I am so happy that I was able to find it. I love the size I love the look, but without function it would just be a neat travel mug--this answers every need. If I want hot tea I just warm the mug up first with warm tapwater while I heat the boiling tea water and add loose tea to the strainer and snap it in the mug (it snaps sung, won't fall out on you). Then when I have water for tea just slowly pour the water over the tea and Wahla! Remove the strainer basket and away you go. If you want infused water, put your fruit or herbs in the mug, snap on the filter and add your water. The fruit stays in the water and you only get flavored water. No junk gets by the filter/strainer basket! AWESOME!! Note: everything BUT the bamboo lid is dishwasher safe. No instructions came with the item. But It is packaged nicely and pretty straight forward.

It has a (horrendous - for me) protective cover over the blades which is often in the way. The stick part really needs to be put in the dishwasher to clean it. I think that the problem is that it does too many things, and lacks the simplicity of a standard sort of stick blender. Also, the 'stick' attaches awkwardly to the motor. Mine just broke. The old standard one which I gave away worked forever.

OTOH, it is powerful, and if you don't mind the hooded blades might be just the thing."

After a lot of digging online, I found an obscure reference to that message pertaining to the failure of the heating element. It didn't seem very common, so I returned the iron and got a replacement. The replacement worked fine with very intermittent usage over the course of a few months. However, I needed to use the iron for a remote task recently. I put it in my toolbox along with some other tools. Upon reaching my destination and firing up the iron, I got the ""h-E"" message again!

I was left without the main tool I needed for the task on that Sunday. Left with few options, I went to Home Depot and picked up a cheap Weller. Lo and behold, the Weller got the job done, and the Hakko is out of commission again.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Meh. Rug does not resemble photos, colors are much deeper and stand out more. Quality seems to be OK, but certainly not so great for the price point. If you need an area rug, it will do....but its much more difficult to incorporate ANYTHING other than neutral colors. Would not recommend for the price, and if i could return? I would."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Simply turn your water off, and it will let you know if it's running. I have one tap water heater in the house, so I can get the temperature of the water in my shower to the correct temp.

If you're thinking about changing your water heater, you should also consider a 2-volt adapter to save money.  There's a cheap solution to this problem.  My water heater has a wire that goes to the heater, and a wire that goes to the outlet.  I've found the 2-volt adapter works"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,Bought this as a replacement. I love the look and feel of this lamp.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Just perfect . no cracks and worked well. The metal neck though is a little wobbly
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Great Product & Service. I use it everyday.Very comfortable.  I love it!Very pretty
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I use this pot for most everything!  This is my second purchase.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Received this promptly and assembled it easily.  I ended up using it as a night light in my living room with a 25 watt light bulb in it.  Love it when I get up at night and wander through my living room to get to the kitchen.  The tiny red and amber beads among the leaves give just enough pop of color to make it charming.  Of course, I turn it on every evening at dusk because it is so beautiful - not too fussy and not too plain.  I don't think you can go wrong with this floor lamp."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Amazing frame! I purchased a 20x30 frame and was worried about what I would get, but it is solidly built and beautiful.  And it came with the proper hardware to hang it, not just a tiny sawtooth piece of junk."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This is actually pretty neat if you don't want to carry multiple tools around at work. It will lock in my small impact driver I use on sheet rock screws or on my 1/2"" drive impact gun without ever walking back to get my drill gun. It's nice if you want to travel light between buildings on a hot day or if you'd rather carry a smaller tool bag for what ever reason. I bought it to get over the $150 special financing requirement and fell in love with it. Not for every one but it sure can save some weight if you drag tools all day."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"I tend to prefer the more bulky, wide-angle lenses.  These work well and are very bright.  I've used them on my son's car, in a shed, and in a bathroom in the hallway.  They're also very comfortable and secure.  The only thing I don't like is the dimmer switch.  I wish it had a dimmer switch.  I would buy these again.  I'm very happy with these"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"I've had this Lunchbots for over a year now.  Overall, it's been a decent container, though only useful for dry goods.  My original intent was to purchase an 'heirloom' lunchbox that was completely foodsafe -- what better choice for that than stainless steel, right?

So anyway, over a year later, the paint regularly chips off.  Each day, there are some paint flakes to be found everyhwere -- in the tote bag I use to carry this container, on the rim, and if I'm not careful, in my food.

Given the times we live in, and that there's no way for me to know for certain whether there's lead, cadmium, or other toxics in the paint, this will soon go into the trash.

In fact, that's why I'm on Amazon today -- I came shopping for a 100% stainless steel replacement.  After seeing this pop up in the search, I thought I'd at least help others by sharing my experience.

Someone did suggest that Lunchbots was extremely customer-service oriented, and would replace the lids -- no questions asked.  That was not my experience at all.  I wrote to customer service, and got a standard 'stock' response back which suggested the product is no longer under warranty and this was considered normal 'wear and tear' -- but that I could buy some replacement lids (which were also painted) if I wanted to, at my expense.

(apparently this comes with a one year warranty, so that's all the product is guaranteed for)

So much for quality and so much for manufacturer product support.

Seriously -- what's the point of spending some $20 for a stainless steel item if it won't last much longer than a year?

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Nice lock. Good looks and easy to install.(If old lock installed correctly)Bought this to replace old lock that had worn out. Installed in about an hour but that included fixing a bad installation previouly. Recomend and would buy again.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This bidet took less than 10 minutes to install. I've had it installed for a couple of months now and it works great.
I was concerned if there would be any leakage around the connector at the main inlet or the product itself, but there's none.
The product is high quality and looks great.

The only glitch is that my toilet seat is now raised up from the front by about an inch and does not sit flush on the pot rim.
(It's a Kohler pot + seat) - This could be due to the design of the toilet seat and the way it locks in.

Plan to install this in the other toilets around the house too."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"We have a couple of ISI whip cream chargers.  In the past, we have mainly used the ISI cartridges.  We decided to try the Purist cartridges because of the big price discount.  Based on about 15 cartridges used so far, we've had perfection operation.  The ISI cartridges were sometimes difficult to puncture, requiring pliers and a protective wrap to tighten the cap enough to penetrate the cartridge.  So far, all the Purist cartridges have penetrated easily and have fully charged the dispensers."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"I am two years late in writing a review, but it is just as well. This item should be fabulous. Two years later, it's not so much. It IS absolutely positively beautiful. Looks to be well made. But has been problematic from the get go. My first one came defective (leaked internally). Getting a replacement was easy through Amazon. But, I still had to pay the plumber twice.

Worked great for about 6 months, then the sprayer started leaking. My bad for not contacting the company. It continues to leak, particularly if water is on high. In addition, it doesn't like to stay seated in the holder. Very disappointing. I love the faucet. Wish it worked better. Needs a bit of a design redo in my opinion."

It works best with the lithium battery but the nicad works just fine although noticeably heavier. After using this tool hard for several days I'm not sure 5 stars is enough. The work performed per pound would have been unimaginable a few years back."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,works great. But boy do I love the fact that you can't just turn it off and off
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,Probably one of the best tools ever made.  I've used it for a couple of years now and it's very well made.  The only thing I didn't like
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Very well made.  Protects my hands from cuts when working on sharp objects.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,I don't usually get jazzed about flashlights but this model has a lot going for it and I have bought three of them.  It uses standard AA batteries instead of the more exotic ones.  It is really bright.  If comparing the beam to a mini mag light you will be amazed at the difference.  The light is well built and solid.  The modes don't matter to me so that is not a subtraction.  You can get a better flashlight and you can spend ten times as much if you really want to.  At this price point this is a great choice.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Well-made, full brushes.  I just started using them, but they feel like they will hold their bristles for years.  Also have a nice, solid set of bristles."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"I like this low-profile digital display. The wide-angle display is nice for a variety of colors.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Love this seat... Never knew what to expect.  Not sure how long it will last but it is a great purchase.  I am using it for the instruction booklet on the floor and it is very well made.  I am a bit skeptical about the price but it is cheaper than the other seat.  I love the fact that I can use the seat with a single hand.  I just wish the seat was a little wider to allow more room for a hand.  I have used this seat for about a month now and I am very happy with it.  I have a few other seats that have a different seat but this one has the same seat that I have for about a month now and it does a good job of keeping my hand free.  I am very happy with the purchase and am glad I purchased this seat.Great for our kitchen.  We had this on our sink and it was really easy to install.  It is a little smaller than I expected, but that is"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I had to step up to a 3/4"" drive socket to break loose the axle nuts on my car.  I broke a 1/2"" breaker bar so I needed something more serious.  This socket, combined with a 3/4"" breaker bar, did the trick nicely.  It stood up to the abuse of a 48"" long breaker bar with another 2-foot cheater pipe slipped over it, and me jumping on the end of it a couple of times.  No problem!  The socket gripped the nut, didn't slip off or round out the nut."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I purchased this for new furniture that will be delivered later this week.  I am used to leather but this time purchased microfiber. Was worried about the dog getting on the recliner and getting it dirty.  Will post a later review on how it works out once furniture is delivered.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Works well for me. I plugged it in on the 2nd floor of a 4,000 square foot house that I own and it's great. It also lights up when the bell rings. Good value if you don't want to be bothered installing a whole new doorbell."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Works great with PODs storage units.  I'm sure it would be easier to break the hasp than to open the lock.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I really like these small inexpensive files. They are a must when working on small objects or in tight areas. Maybe it is just my set, but there are not 10 different files. I got 2 round, two square and two flat, same size, same grit, and that is why I gave 3 stars. I will use them all until they are worn out and buy some more."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,We love this new lock on our door. You can program many different codes so everyone can have their own code so they don't forget it. We love the keyless entry instead of waiting on someone with the keys to open the door.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Got this 4 days ago, so far so good. I bought this for my husband who has developed allergies in the last year. We have two long haired cats and a 85 pound Lab. His allergies were so bad last week he woke up short of breath and couldn't sleep. I let this run on high for 6 hours the first day, then switched it to medium the first night. I turn it off when we wake up and switch it on an hour or two before bedtime. My husband has been able to sleep through the night and wakes up rested. He is also much less congested so his snoring has reduced which was a huge bonus for me. The meduim setting may take getting use to for some. I have a white noise sleep machine (to block out the snoring) and it is a little louder than that. It doesnt bother us but we are use to it. The quiet setting is even quieter than my sleep machine. I would definitely recommend this for anyone that suffers from pet allergies and doesnt want to have to shave or give up thier beloved pets. I also bought an allergy pillow cover and that may be contributing as well."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I needed a gift for someone I see socially and yet keep it light and kind of funny.  Knowing she loves wine and has a great sense of humor...this was perfect.  She loved it and it really does look a little more expensive than it is and also I love to personalize a gift and this fit into all categories.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"I think I bought 6 of these for a new house. We live in a rural area where the electrical service provided by the co-op is pretty shakey. So we have a lot of power outages. Whole lotta fun being waken up at 3 or so in the morning when a power outage causes one of these alarms to trigger. It took a while to figure out the problem and isolate the one bad one. Looking at the warranty instructions, I would have to pay shipping both ways and most probably they would say there is nothing wrong with it. Nope, not gonna play that game."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Works great, and actually useful.  I love the look and feel of this lamp, the way the lamp is so bright.  I am using it in the kitchen, in a shed, in a bathroom, in the hallway, in a bedside table, and in my back yard.  It is a great lamp, and it will make the kitchen and bedroom look like they are sitting on a bed.  I have installed a few more on my bathrooms and a few more on my back yard.  I am going to be using this lamp for a year or so before I can use it"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,This is the best food processor I have ever used. I use it for my frozen fruit and vegetables.  I love the fact that it can get the job done.

I have a lot of fresh veggies and I like that I can store them in it.  I also like the fact that
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I don't remember the last time I owned a hand vac.  Never been inclined to buy one before because the suction wasn't that great and they're difficult to keep clean.  This one has all the power I need and the battery (so far) hasn't been a problem.  So much so, I bought 2 more on a clearance sale.  As someone else said, I don't understand the negative comments.  The blower is at the bottom but so far I haven't had any problem with picking up dust and even feathers which get randomly get blown into my house.  The detachable cone is simple to undo and empty however on the down side, the filter is not that easy to clean.  Dust, especially if you try washing it, gets stuck between the crevices.  Also, the crevice and brush tool don't snap in so they easily pop out.  Had to apply a bit of duct tape."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I like the ergonomic curves of the ""tractor"" style seat. The chair is light, and not heavy duty, but it's comfortable enough and rolls around nicely."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I like dot patterns and this is a nice utility pack. It opens to 2 major compartments with 2 other zip pockets ( one internal and one external, on top). The zip on lunch bag is a great idea for those of us who look like Hannibal crossing the Alps when we go to work. The lunch bag is big enough for a cold pack and my modest lunch. It might make the load ungainly if you overload the lunch bag.

Not a lot of bells and whistles here otherwise; there is a side pocket for a water bottle. This pack is a little small for day to day commuting for me but will get a lot of weekend use. I think it would be perfect for older school kids and simplify their morning routine. The colors of my pack are significantly different than the photo of the dot pattern."

If you have been looking for a pair of the best ear plugs in the world, you're in luck. This ear plug is made in China.

I was skeptical about the price, but it's not the price that's going to scare the heck out of me. I'm sure you can't beat it for the price.

I used it to replace a pair of ear plugs in my home that were broken in the house. The new plugs were already out of service.

I was worried about the price and the hassle of replacing the plugs, but it's not that. I bought these plugs because I wanted to keep a pair of them in my family room.

I had a pair of these ear plugs that I used for my first pair of ear plugs. The first pair was on sale for $11.00 each. I thought it was good, but the second pair was $6.00 each. I went through the process of replacing the pair of plugs and would not return them.

I was told to wait for the new plugs to come out. I did not have to wait.

I keep them in the car and on the road so I don't have to worry about them falling off the car or on my way to work. I love that they are small enough to be easy to carry around. I love that they are made of fiberglass so they are more absorbent. I have used these for a couple of months now"

If removed properly, the adhesive will NOT remove any paint or vinyl at all.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"I had and constantly used this tool, and it worked flawlessly. The only downside is that it's very hard to get a good grip on the handle. The handle is straight, and it's not really stiff enough to hold a finger. This is a problem for most people. The only real flaw is that the grip is too loose. I've had this tool for a few years now and it's still strong. However, I would not recommend this tool to anyone who is looking for a sturdy, secure, and comfortable hand grip. I'm glad I found this tool, because it was a pleasure to use. The company I work for should have started to make better tools. This is a great tool for getting things done at home. It's sturdy, holds a great angle, and is a good value. I don't recommend this tool to anyone who is looking for a good quality tool. I really like the quality of this knife. It's sharp and very well made. I don't like the way the blade is curved, but it's a nice knife for my needs. The blade is made of metal, which means it's not sharpened like a regular blade. The knife is sharp enough to be used in a pinch, but that's okay because it's not meant for everyday use. The blade is sharp enough to be used for several projects, but I would not recommend it for a heavy project like this."

It feels sturdy enough, but we don't move it much, and we've made a point of leaning the lid against the wall after reading about problems with the hinges. My only complaint is that there isn't a good way to install a liner bag. The hinges prevent you from just hanging it over the edge. I used a couple of command hooks to hold my bag up, but it's not an ideal solution."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"When I went to screw the charges in the first few times, the metal took the skin off my finger. A few days later I noticed both of my pointer fingers had a chunk of skin missing and I'd be bleeding and have no idea why, until the 3rd time it happened and then I figured it out. Very sharp and dangerous. You can see how it can happen in the picture."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"I've been waiting and researching for LED replacement GU10 bulbs that would have the lumen output to satisfy my lighting requirement. These bulbs had claimed all that I was looking for. Color, dimmable, and lumens. But, in reality, they are: GU10 LED bulb replacements, are dimmable, are the right color, but are most definitely not anywhere near the lumen output that is claimed. Actual measurement was 210 lumen each.
Just keep waiting folks. The tech will eventually get it right."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I bought these on my quest to replace all my bulbs with LED. These went in a chandelier that takes 4 bulbs and left me 1 spare. The bulbs are very very white without the fixture covers of the chandelier. My chandelier has an offwhite/yellowish cover over each that is open ended. That makes the light look warm. Without that, these are cool white (I ordered the 6000K bulbs because of the covers). I had 4 of the 25 watt halogens in my chandelier drawing 100 watts total. With these bulbs, I am drawing only 3 watts each at 12 watts total. It is just as bright. The bulbs should last a lot longer and didn't cost any more than the halogens I bought at Wal-Mart. I would suggest getting warm white if not going into a fixture that warms the light...that is unless you like super white light."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I was puzzled to see why this only has four stars, since mine is beautiful and works great. I did have to unscrew it when I first got it because the battery had come loose and was rolling around in the lamp, but I simply stuck it back into place and the lamp works fine. The colors are vibrant and really pop both during the day and when it's lit up at night. And the light is actually a rather bright white, which is emitted from a small stalk of three tiny LED lights gathered into a bunch at the bottom, like grapes. The stake leaves a little something to be desired, though, since it was a little difficult to put together (I had to take the screw out of the pole and then re-insert it, since it was in crooked) and it's not the sturdiest while in the ground. The stake itself is fine enough, but the pole is so narrow that it can't really support the weight of the lantern, which causes the lamp to easily swivel around. But once it's in place, it's fine. I have it next to my walkway to add curb appeal to the front yard, and it looks really pretty both during the day and at night. I was debating getting a second one simply for better symmetry, but the one lantern as it is looks perfectly fine, even charming by itself."

People who do not know how to use one. unskilled home owner. can ruin the BEST most EXPENSIVE tool on the Market. When cutting. push the Saw all the way down on the FOOT and apply adequate pressure to keep it there as sawing. do not FORCE the SAW too hard to make the cut. Watch out for BLADE BINDING by the Material you are cutting starts pinching the blade. you can burn the Motors out by too much MUSCLE forcing it down thru the cut. or binding the blade!.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I used a few of these to replace the halogen tube type bulbs in a few ceiling light fixtures with standard LED bulbs.  My worry with halogen bulbs is has always been the intense heat they put out in a small space, like a light fixture.  By making a few simple modifications to the fixture, and installing one of these standard bulb sockets to replace the halogen bulb holder, I change a fixture from consuming 100 watts to consuming about 10 watts and eliminate a LOT of wasted and potentially dangerous heat in the fixture.

Easy to do if you're reasonably mechanically inclined and have some electrical knowledge....just be safe and make sure you know what you're doing.  First thing of course, turn the power off to the fixture!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I was looking for a pair of cheap, basic lamps, and while looking through lamp designs I didn't like at all trying to find something that I liked, this lamp popped up in the related items.

I instantly knew this was the lamp. I was going for an Asian/Zen theme for my living room and while I had decided on plain lamps due to budgetary reasons, these fit the theme almost perfectly. Reading reviews, I ordered two and hoped I would receive an unbroken/uncrushed one.

When they arrived they were packed well inside their boxes. Form-fitting foam and plastic bags/wrap around the base and shade. Both lamps were intact. The shades were also uncrushed, but I accidentally put a small ding in both as I was unwrapping the plastic from them (they're kind of a plasticky paper that once dented will retain a visible crease line even if the dent is popped back out.) Fortunately the creases are small, and not really noticeable and I put them towards the back anyway.

The lamps were slightly smaller than I thought, but I'm not disappointed in them. The very bottom of each ""stone"" is indeed unpainted/unglazed, but it's not visible unless you look at it from below. I can also confirm what another reviewer said. These use regular bulbs, not candelabra bulbs, So if the listing is still recommending them, ignore it. The instructions list a 40-watt as the intended bulb, but since heat isn't an issue with LEDs, I've got a 60-watt equivalent in the lamps.

Also, the listing says the color is black and grey. This is wrong. They're dark grey and light grey. I wish these were available in black and dark grey, which would fit the Zen theme even better. I've thought about repainting them as such, but I'd have to sand off the current glaze, repaint them, then gloss coat them. That's more trouble and cost than I want to go through for these lamps. So I'm just using them as-is."

They dim to 10%, while the more expensive GE bulb barely dims to 40%. I love it when a product exceeds my expectations and seeing the word dimmable on the box was a wonderful surprise.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This cookie sheet is a thin silicone membrane with a silicone covered metal frame and handles that is oven safe to 400 The baking surface dimension is not a perfect rectangle; the width of the edges measure 10 1/2 wide, the center 11. I was able to fit nine 2 1/2 cookies on a sheet; a standard cookie sheet will hold twelve.
When you take the baking sheet out of the oven you need to use the handles; if you grab the edges with your fingers under the membrane you will deform it and crack some of the cookies.  You do need to be careful with cleaning and storage because the membrane is vulnerable to puncturing.
Overall this sheet is well made and met my expectations for a non-stick silicone baking surface. But because of the size, care and storage I didn't find it to be as useful as I hoped.  I will use it more as specialty equipment for baking something very sticky like Florentines but continue to use my traditional cookie sheets with Silpats or parchment paper for most of my baking."

I've read a lot of reviews that said they would not buy this light, but I'm skeptical of that. I don't know if this light is a flashlight, a flashlight, a flashlight, or a flashlight. I just want a flashlight that will last. I have a few other reviews that I would recommend. I will update this review after I get more information. This is a good product. It looks great and works great. I bought a second one for a larger room because I had a couple of 2s that were too small for the smaller one. It came with a pair of gloves and it works great. The price is a little high for a little and the price is not a big deal."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,These are super cute and look amazing in the kitchen. I will definitely be buying more!I am a big fan
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,CG,I bought this to use on a professional project and it works great.  The yellow coated one is a little too yellow for the most typical area but the light is so bright it's nice to have.  It's a little pricey for a flashlight but I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I have a portable flashlight and I can't wait to use it on a regular basis.  It's bright and it's pretty accurate.  I like that the light is centered on the surface of the desk where the light is mounted.  It's not quite so small that you can easily see it from a distance.  It's not too big as it would be
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I have received it before the range day of delivery. It was shipped from China, so it wasn't that bad. It is actually smaller pillow case (more like 16,5""X 17""). It looks nice and quality is good (I hope it will stay this way after washing it).  It has an error in the material on the side of the print. It is not that visible, but it is there. I also thought it will be a little bit lighter color, but I still like it. I think for the price this is really a good pillow case,worth my few spend bucks."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,This tool fills a need that has been missing from many of our tools for years. This is a great tool that is easy to use and is well-made. I would definitely recommend this tool to anyone. I would highly recommend it. Very good value. Great for the price.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"We received a promo code for this cutting board, but definitely would have paid the regular price.  We were looking for a beautiful board to cut, display, and serve the large cuts of grilled or sous vide beef that we like to prepare for large gatherings.  This is perfect!  We especially like to non-slide silicone feet at the bottom of the board to keep it from moving around during cutting and serving."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,It doesn't stay in place well. After a number of hot water experiences it still does not lie flat. The suction cups don't work well in our jacuzzi because the floor is not smooth. It is still nice to lay on.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,OMG This smells so good. I love the taste. My husband likes it too.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I have only used it twice so far but it is super easy and makes incredibly tasty yogurt. I have only used the organic store bought plain for a starter but it has been good. Easy set up, clean up and saves a ton on those little 5oz cartons that we were eating up so quickly."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"A nice idea that my daughter loved, too bad the quality was so poor that it couldn't even last through its Second Use."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"This gets a 5 star because it is lightweight and comfortable.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy.

The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because I don't like the material.  I prefer the more polyester color, which is a good thing.

I also like the shape of the cover, which is nice for putting on the shower curtain. "
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"DO NOT leave home without this wine opener!! Seriously, why all the bad reviews? Maybe quality was an issue when they first came out, but it's 2018 and I've had mine for 3 years now. I bought it specifically because it has NO BLADE, thus it is TSA-approved! I can take it anywhere! I constantly find myself in the situation of having a bottle of wine and no opener. Sometimes when traveling across the country, sometimes just traveling across town. Instead of buying a corkscrew in another state only to have it thrown away when I get to the airport, I keep this blade-free gem in my purse at all times. I have LITERALLY gotten high-fives from TSA agents who stare in amazement that there is indeed NO BLADE on this baby! I love it so much that I'm getting one for my mother and mother-in-law to keep in their purses. If you travel often and love wine, get this corkscrew ASAP."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"This is an interesting product; kind of a cross between wax and silicone.  It can be used as a polish and also as a sealer/barrier to keep surfaces from oxidizing.  It's a small container, but should last a long time.

The best uses I have found are on objects that are a combination of wood and metal; it can be used on both.  So polishing a gun or knife can be a one step process.  I also used it on a newly purchased wooden work bench to help protect it.  Overall a good buy and great for home/automotive use."

I don't make a living pulling cables but I have, at times, helped installers run network and power cables at home and the office. So I do have some exposure to expensive brands of fish rods. I am putting in a home theater system with a projector in my daughter's playroom and I decided to do-it-myself as a bit of weekend therapy. Now, knowing I was going to use the rods only a few times I did not want to spend more than was necessary. So these rods seemed to fit the bill and I figured I could return them if they were really bad. I imagine I'm a fairly typical user of this product in that you buy it for one or two projucts and that's it. A professional would not find these durable enough for daily use.

Yes, they are a little thin but I was only putting cables into mostly internal wall spaces and not needing to run them over and around complicated obstacles. Unless of course you count insulation and AC wiring cables!  I found no problem with the brass ferrules and not once did I have any issue with the ends breaking off but remember I was only using them for a day. It might have been helpful if they were a little thicker pushing by insulation but it really wasn't that bad. Once the extra  flexibility was really helpful. I was using only two or three at a time.

One last thing - I have seen the price of the rods change by $10 or so from one day to the next, Use camel camel camel dot com to check on pricing if you are not in a rush"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Best cake pans on the market!  I now have a small collection of these pans in different sizes and they are fantastic!  They make a huge difference in the final  product.  Don't need to wrap the pans in baking strips because the pans are double insulated on all sides as well as the bottom, so everything bakes evenly.  I bake a lot including several wedding cakes and countless birthday cakes, everything homemade, and I swear by these pans.  Customer service is really great.  I had some a question and the customer service representative was so helpful and gave some great advice.  This company takes baking very seriously. Between the product, customer service, and the change they made to the sticky labels that come on the product (they come off much easier now), they have a devoted follower in me."

I don't remember how many I've had over the years, since Gerber started making them around 1980, and how many I've lost or mislaid. This is one I won't be without. I give them as gifts at Christmas and have never had one returned, hahaha!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"It's all but impossible to get one of these that is not cloudy.  The wax formula used in these is not very good, and it doesn't take much shaking for it to diffuse into the water, making it so cloudy you can't see the wax blob at all.  It's pretty much a guarantee that it's going to be shaken during shipping and that you'll receive junk.

Upon contacting the manufacturer, they offered to send replacements over and over again, but no one would address the real problem:  Isn't something wrong with the product if you can't even ship it without it being destroyed?

For those stuck with these lamps, here is one DIY solution:  When the lamp is cold, very gently open the bottle cap on top with a tiny flat-head screw driver.  Loosen the teeth of the cap all the way around just enough to get the cap off.  Do not use a bottle opener, because it will bend the cap in the middle and you'll never get it to seal tightly again.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This pan has a thick bottom, somewhat thinner sides (but not too thin) and the non-stick coating is excellent. I don't bother to shape the dough much, I just put dollops in each section and they come out more or less scone shaped. Once you get the baking time and temperature right the thick walls ensure that the bottom and sides get enough heat to develop just a hint of crust."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I installed this thermostat on a single stage Water Furnace geothermal unit.  Despite a minor glitch in the beginning it has been running very well.  When I first installed it there was a firmware issue that shut my unit down and led to a very cold morning, but customer service was great and they updated the firmware over the phone.  I do wish the thermostat came with more technical details as I still had multiple questions that were not covered in the manual, once again customer service was great in answering them.  My goal in installing this unit was to eliminate my electric backup heat from kicking on in cold weather.  It has succeeded in doing this.  It can be -10 degrees out and my geothermal unit will not need the backup.  It does run longer but it is still more cost effective than paying for the electric heat.  I like how it learns how long it takes your house to heat up or cool down and then automatically adjusts the run times to have the house at the correct temperature by the time you want it.  Having a geothermal unit is a lot different than a regular heating system as it cannot handle large swings in temperature especially in heating mode.  I have my house set to 65 in the day and 63 at night / away.  That's about the biggest swing my geothermal unit can handle.  Even with this small swing in temperature I am noticing lower electric bills by about $30 a month.  I love the computer interface for programming it and the graphs that show you detailed usage reports and data."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is the best invention ever!  I was always afraid of pressure cookers because of the noises that came from the ones used by my parents when I was a kid. I always thought the top was going to blow off at any minute!  That fear kept me from pressure cooking for a very long time. I happened to see a Youtube video of someone cooking in one of these and they explained that they are safe because there are several layers of safety designed right into this that prevent the problems associated with the earlier stove-top pressure cookers.  Curious, I purchased this one and now I'm hooked.  There are 4 appliances in my kitchen that I cannot live without: my Zojirushi rice cooker, Nuwave oven, Nutribullet, and my Instant Pot!  If any one of these wore out I'd just turn around and immediately order another one!

You can't go to a junk food drive through and get back home any faster than you can cook delicious meals in this without leaving the house!

One more thing - the food that comes out of this has sooooooo much flavor!  Any spices you use are forced into the meat because its cooked under pressure.  Your meat is tender, flavorful and juicy.  Mmmmm good!  There are so many recipes available and tons of Youtube videos for cooking ideas.  Get one - have fun, and enjoy delicious food in a little time."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"This is a great, compact, portable handy-dandy item to carry in my car. I appreciated the insert showing the various features, but wondered why a power adapter (DC5V,500mA, whatever THAT is!) wasn't included to charge the unit.  Manufactures would be well-advised to remember that Baby Boomers still want to get out camping, or maybe even just upgrade our emergency gear. We will pay for quality, but need buttons to be easily read, instructions clear, and prefer all parts included.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Husbands don't share power tools.  They are the tools you need to keep your hands in when you need them.  Some of the tools are also designed to be used in a pinch, but it's a little difficult to grip your hand when you are holding it.  If you have a small hand, it's a bit harder to grip the tool when you are holding it.  I have my hands on all four tools, and none of them have held up well.  The tool I have is a very heavy tool, but I use it everyday for cutting, drilling, and other jobs.  I have a small hand, but it's too big for that.  I'll be taking it out and putting it back together.  It's a very heavy tool, but it's a very small tool, so it won't be as good as a full-sized one.  I'm not a big guy, so I don't know how many tools I have in my hands.

I have had many of these tools, and none of them have held up well.  The tools are more expensive than the ones I have, but they still work great.  They're not all that strong, but they're nice and strong.  I am pleased with the quality of these tools.  They are small enough that I can carry them in my pocket or even my hand.

Other than that I like how absorbent it is.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"Of the three Tunable White BR30 bulbs I bought three months ago, one is already dead.  (That's a really, really short life for an LED bulb!)

Even before that, there were a couple of flaws that really bothered me:

- Apparently, you can set the default color temperature if, and only if, you have the Sylvania hub.  I don't have the Sylvania hub; I'm using SmartThings.  With SmartThings, I'm stuck with 2700k lights (at initial power delivery); we wanted something closer to 6500k.  I don't really want to purchase a new, dedicated hub for a one-time settings pressing.  (This is absolutely a preference thing, but feel like there ought to be some other way to do this; you shouldn't have to buy a hub for a one-time use if they're going to tout compatibility with another hub!)

- Pairing mode is too easily triggered.  I have a toddler and on multiple occasions now, she's managed to put the bulbs back into pairing mode (which unpairs them from our hub).  GE Link bulbs' pairing process was an absolute pain, but we never accidentally triggered pairing with a few off/on toggles like we have with the Sylvania bulbs.

- The dimmest setting isn't as dim as Hue or LIFX bulbs (but seems to be on par with GE Link and Sengled).

- SmartThings Routines that trigger changes to brightness and color temperature sometimes only do one or the other.

Two of the three bulbs still work, but we're not really using them as smart, tunable bulbs because of the flaws listed above."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I am a hot sleeper! My husband tells me that my body gives off so much heat that I'm like a furnace. That being said, I tend to sweat a lot in my sleep and a lot of the times I wake up from sweating so much. I sleep with a ceiling fan blowing on high and my tower fan blowing on high and I sleep with it on all year round, even when it gets to be below freezing because my body just gets too hot. Well, someone told me a while ago to try out a cooling gel pillow to sleep with to see if it helps so I ordered this gel memory foam pillow to see if maybe it did something for me. I tried it out and immediately felt the cooling sensation on the back of my neck and upper back but was it actually going to help keep me cool during the night to where I don't wake up from sweating. Yes! It did and does and I now do not sleep without this wonderful pillow. It has helped me get longer sleep since I'm not waking in the night. I am so pleased with this pillow and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is a hot sleeper like I am or even if you just like a cold feeling pillow. I love this pillow. I would not sleep on it alone though, I put it on top of my other pillow and it's perfect. I hope this helps you make a purchase!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This is a nice inexpensive sauce pan I think has middle-grade quality. In size, this little pot is suitable for making a 1 to 2 cup sauce from a rue. Two cups would be pushing it, and more I would advise against, since you have to have room to stir and/or whisk. Since the little pan is Teflon lined I'd suggest you only use  soft, heat resistant silicone utensils. And since the pot is small, one of the smallest whisks. I've tested the pot by making a sauce, melting butter, and by boiling chicken livers for my pups. What I found is that the heating is even, and that the Teflon surface works great. Chicken livers, you see, turn out to leave behind a foamy and sticky protein residue which can be tough to clean up even when on Teflon. I like the ceramic exterior, by the way. It doesn't show water spots or fingerprints. Unfortunately it's unattractive. This surprised me because I like speckle-ware, and I like the color red. The combo on this pot however just didn't work for me. So while I like this little pot (which does not come with a lid), I like it more as an accent piece in the kitchen and I know I'd not like a complete set of it. Would just be too much. Other things I would note is that the handle stayed cool and you absolutely should not put any Teflon pan in the dishwaster. Thoughtfully designed to have pour spouts for both lefties and righties, this is a nice pan (not upscale, but nice) for very little money."

The reason for the one star is that after the the fourth usage it broke completely in half, when I simply lifted the stone out of the oven.  It was already a week outside of the return window because I don't make pizza at home that often.  I am not sure why it broke in half.  Perhaps the difference between the hot oven and 70 degree room temperature.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I got the 3-pack and put one of them in an old torchiere floor lamp I had sitting around and the other two in my garage. The floor lamp had been pretty much useless because it was rated for a 60 watt bulb and I needed more illumination in my living room than that, I put in a couple of sets of halogen track lights years ago and I hadn't even bothered turning it on since. These actually only consume 11 watts, making it safe to use them in the lamp so now I get to use a 100 watt equivalent bulb.

But wait, there's more. I did a little informal comparison between this bulb and some other lights and I think that it's a little better than two 60 watt soft white bulbs when it comes to lighting up my room, and it's just as good as one of the halogen track light units. My family agrees with me on this; so, while it's hardly a scientific analysis, practically speaking, it'll do. (I think the main reason is that daylight spectrum reflects better off the white walls and ceiling than soft white.) It's also way cheaper to operate. I also prefer them in the garage to the soft white bulbs they replaced. They do cost a bit more up front than halogens, and quite a bit more than incandescents but with a much longer life and a small fraction of the cost to operate them I think they're an excellent purchase."

The not so good:

- The light it gives off tends to dim out fairly quickly (after a week or so) if you want to leave it on all night.  It does have a cool feature where it will turn off after 10-15 minutes (see description for actual lenght), but we need one that stays on all night.

Has a very adequate and comfortable silicone handle = doesn't get hot.
Stands up to what one would expect at this price point, and it doesn't disappoint.

the non stick coating may lose its effectiveness. So I would interpret that as a no.

> Can be used on all stove tops = gas - electric - vitro ceramic stove top - induction - halogen & in the oven.
Pan does not come with a lid, but any 7 7/8"" (rim inset - to rim inset) lid will fit well.
In our cupboard = a Chantal = Revere Ware - & Calphalon lid fit perfectly.

Made in Italy
(We have some other pans and utensils from Italy of which have turned out to be some of our best & favorite kitchen items)

Manufacture states this is scratch & stain resistant.
10 times more resistant to sticking than normal non stick coatings. (which I believe is true)
18/10 stainless steel
PFOA free
---------------------

No grease.
Within seconds of egg hitting the pan, the thin front edge cooked and rolled upwards.
Egg was quickly nicely browned, which made it easier to flip without breaking.
Took about 30 seconds on top side = over easy = done.
Lifted egg out, pan was clean."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"It works pretty good. Doesn't heat my bigger candles to the point of filling the room with an aroma even close to lighting it. The smaller candles smell wonderful using this candle warmer though, without any combustion or smoke, so that's great. Buyer beware though, this is made of plastic which means it is very unsafe to use more than a couple of hours or the plastic may begin to melt. Most companies have moved over to ceramic candle warmers to avoid this issue, but if you just want something cheap and you are not a forgetful person then this candle warmer is stellar and sits at a great price."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I purchased this at Bed Bath and Beyond 15 months ago. It squeegees the glass very well, and the suction cup fixture stays up. (It detached just once, in the seasonal change from humid to dry weather.) No rust, and the rubber blade has stayed flexible. The folding design keeps the squeegee off to the side, out of sight.

Yet, I'm unhappy: the folding pivot point has loosened over these 15 months. If it was just a bit ""wiggly,"" that might be okay. However, the pivot and its fold-lock mechanism are obviously parting ways. The squeegee is no longer effective because the blade cannot be held perpendicular at the end of the swiveling handle.

My experience with this squeegee is similar to other ""simplehuman"" products I've used in the past. They look well-designed, with an aesthetic similar to Oxo and other neo-design products. But, their engineering has invariably incorporated flaws that eventually destroy the product's usefulness. I'll be replacing this squeegee with one from another manufacturer, and not purchasing from this line again."

Only thing that makes me a tad upset is why the heck didn't these come with these sealing rings on them already.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This kit comes with everything you need to polish metal. I took the guards and grinding wheels off an old 6"" grinder I had. I installed the buffing wheels and had the machine buffing parts in only a few minutes.

It comes with roughing blocks for course, fine, and extra fine. I didn't notice a brown block since it looked like I got two grey blocks; not a big deal for me since the three grits do exactly what I need. If you are doing jewelry, then you need the extra fine that this kit provides, but the fine will be enough to finish most general polishing. Because there are three different grades of roughing blocks, the kit also comes with three different grades of buffing wheels. You need these to keep from mixing the grits of the roughing blocks onto the same wheels.

The instruction manual is clear on how to use the kit and to get a good polish. It also shows which roughing grades to use on which metals.

So far I have polished about 23 steel, brass, and iron parts with great results. I also buffed plastic parts; one of which were the plastic headlights on a car. This kit had them looking almost new.

I am very happy with this kit and glad I didn't spend the money to buy the items separately.

UPDATE: Its been 1.5 years since I started using this kit. I have used it so much that the wheels now need to be replaced and I need more roughing blocks. So, I just bought another one of these kits on sale since it was cheaper than buying all the parts separately. I have buffed so many things that I wonder how I ever got along without it before. I even cleaned up some of my wife's jewelry."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Works great. To address some negative reviews: 1. If the voltage of your battery drops below 0.89 volts it will not turn on at all. The flashlight is not broken. Put a new battery in it. I know this is not intuitive if you're used to filament bulb flashlights but this is a LED and that's the way they work.

2. Flashlight behaves erratically. It has an emergency strobe mode that can be engaged by pressing the button halfway down. That's the way it's supposed to work. If you don't want it to do that press the on/off switch all the way down."

When it works, this is a great flashlight/work light.  Extremely bright.  Strong magnets for attaching to ferrous surfaces.  The bottle opener is weird, but hey WTF.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"From some distance away, this 6-foot garland looks fairly realistic, but you get too close, and you can see the vinyl/plastic look to it. The color is definitely realistic. Some of these garlands you buy are a fake-looking bright green, but this is comparable to a real pine color. There are circle hooks at each end of the garland for easy attaching to your banister or fireplace mantle. I will be using it on our upstairs balcony, since it looks better from a distance. Wish it was a little longer - maybe 8 to 10 ft. The product did come rolled nicely in the plastic packaging, so it wasn't twisted or tangled. I'd recommend packing it the same way when storing your Christmas decorations. Each twig of pine is individually attached to the main branch, which I'm not a fan of, but for the price, it's an adequate decor item. Will post photo soon.

I really didn't like setting up my saw for precision cuts before. It always took too long, too much stuff, and too much time. Now I just roll it into the truck and away I go and the supports slide out far enough to actually help. I would have preferred it be a little narrower, and as others have said, solid tires instead of inflatable. Its really heavy but it's easy to move around and saves me time every time I use the saw.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Bought this sturdy 1/2"" shank bit to create my own Slatwall shelving from an unused laminated kitchen shelf. I only needed a couple of shelves for the limited space and buying a full sheet of Slatwall was prohibitively expensive and would delay the project.

Technically, this cuts a T-slot that's a bit larger than true Slatwall, but it works.

I ran the melamine shelf board through my table saw with the blade raised to just under the depth of the cutter's eventual depth. Then I moved the fence over and cut it again to create a 1/4"" dado. This removed a good deal of material so the cutter didn't have to work so hard.

I then used my router table and its rip fence to create the T-slot. Cut some scrap first to assure the proper depth. Worked like a charm.

A 2'x4' piece of Slatwall goes for $58. This $18 cutter and some scrap 3/4"" melamine did the trick and I can use the cutter again for a long time. And I have no unusable leftover Slatwall pieces. Nor did I have to wait for the Slatwall to be delivered. (It's not stocked locally.)

I already had some Slatwall 6"" shelf brackets I got at Amazon at for a previous project.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/KC-Store-Fixtures-A01724-Slatwall-Shelf-Bracket-6-34-Black-Pack-of-25/dp/B013KA7UI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">KC Store Fixtures A01724 Slatwall Shelf Bracket, 6"", Black (Pack of 25)</a>

As you can see, you must purchase 25 of them at a time. I had already used 20 of them in my pantry so the five leftovers went to this project. Perfect.

I cut some 9/16"" thick shelves from some old 1x12s I had salvaged from an old project and planed them down from 3/4"", then sprayed some water-based MinWax Polycrylic on them for protection.

Obviously, this cutter is only economical if you already have the other tools. But it's a great economical addition to my router bit collection."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Paid 206 dollars for this black, with butcher block top, Dolly Madison Kitchen Cart at Amazon.  I actually bought two of them.  For the price they deserve 5 stars but they were not perfect.  They came boxed nicely with lots of foam but the top and bottom pieces of one unit had damage (minor) on one corner.  Problem is the damage had to have been done pre-packaging which means someone dropped it and still packed it up for shipping. Also, there was one internal nut missing from the same spot on both units.  I was able to Jerry rig it by inserting a small wood dowel into the holes to hold them together.  Also, that same hole on one unit was too small to plug with the finishing plugs. Directions were not so great but I had no trouble assembling them with the help of my daughter.  It took us almost 4 hours to do the first one, counting rounding up the necessary tools and getting all the parts out of the box.  We were able to whip the second one together in only an hour. I am very pleased with the quality of these.  The backs are made of wood panels and slats and looks good from behind, the drawers glide nice and the magnets on the cabinet doors are strong.  Everything seemed to be made of actual solid wood.  I will say they were very heavy boxes when they arrived."

Way to ruin a nice set of tools, Wiha.  I'm returning this set, and looking for another manufacturer.  I had high hopes, though I saw another comment from 2014 stating this same problem, I figured Wiha would have gotten around to addressing this problem in the 2 years since.  Boy was I wrong.

I figured they would be fair to moderately bright and maybe be able to be changed from white to colors. I had no idea that they were programmable, had presets you can make, the controls are more than robust, they are amazing! As you can see in the video and photos these things can be made to shine brighter or dimmer, and any color combination you can think of or of course the solid colors of Red, Yellow, Green, and Blue. The ability to change the settings are endless and was fun to play with.
What I like is these are bright enough to be used to illuminate a work bench or a working area, and also as decorative lighting like I am going to use them for.
These LED lights are more than I had hoped for and are amazing for the price. They are on a strip which you can cut to length and is adhesive backed. I will be using some extra strength double sided tape to help hold it in place.

If you need LED strip lighting for indoor use, this is definitely something you can use and able to do more than people think! My son wants some now for his room to put up.

After one use on the stovetop the bottom of the pan on the outside began to wear off and became sticky. I sent back ASAP. Not sure if I got a faulty pan but I didn't want to take any chances.

I had to replace a couple of the light fixtures in the house and it's still working well. It's a little pricey for a new light fixture but it's cheaper than the other lights. I have a few of them in the house and they are bright enough to see. I just installed them with the wire stripper and they work great. It's very easy to program and to program them for a specific purpose. You can program them for a specific area by either clicking on the box and selecting the desired color, or by turning on/off the light. I'll be using them for the new home and I hope they last a long time. I've had no problems with them so far.

The installation instructions were good but I found myself wanting to return them. They were a little hard to follow but I figured that was the end of it. The instructions were very simple and the instructions were helpful.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,This clock is a really fun idea. The numbers do show up on the wall or ceiling as advertised. The color matched exactly as it shows. I think the most surprising thing about this clock was the fact that the protection only stays on for a short period of time. Perhaps even only 60 seconds then shuts off. Also it ruins strictly off of batteries. No wall plug provided. One thing I found interesting was if the table on which the clock is sitting is bumped the protection then turns on as well. Otherwise my 10 year old daughter really does enjoy the clock. She was extremely excited about it and I wouldn't say any of the features really disappointed her.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This Kohree actually is perfect for under my cabinets. My kitchen just happens to be centered in the house due to an old addition. The setup makes it rather dark. Years ago we had some lighting installed, but it ran rather hot. Every now and then, wed burn the tops of our hands or arms when reaching for something. The nice thing about LED lighting of all kinds is that its totally efficient and doesnt run hot.

There at ten LED lights / chips in this strip that emanate quite a bit of light when in that motion-sensing mode. If there is light in the room the Kohree won't go on and enters into an energy-saving mode. It can be used in many places and can be installed permanently by its adhesive strip if you so desire. I do like to move these around so Ive yet to install any light such as this one.

The motion-sensing ability is excellent and quite sensitive, something I do like to see. The Kohree is rather like a torch or flashlight and is approximately 1-3/16 (W) x 7-1/2 (L) x 5/8 (D). I find it rather easy to hold in my hand and Ive actually placed it in one of those hard-to-reach places under my desk so I can check out my tower. The light is quite bright and works well to light up a small area.

The Kohree takes three AAA batteries (not included), but theyll last a long time. Regardless of how long your batteries last, the LED chips should last about 50,000 hours. The technology is amazing and makes it so much easier (and less expensive) to provide small lighting sources in the home. Love this little light!

FEATURES:

 High-Efficiency, LED technology is applied.
 High bright, low power consumption, long operating life, energy saving.
 Suitable for the stairway, cabinet, closet, wardrobe, corridor, workshop, basement, garage, oil depots, roof, door, garage entrances and other places.
 Auto switching on when detecting people coming
 Operating temp :-20C-45C.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Lately I have been trying to put together affordable every day (EDC) pen lights among some other stronger lumen tactical lights for other applications. I recently bought the Milwaukee pen light and this Coast pen light to compare. This Coast Pen Light is definitely a focused light, just like its advertised, a focused light for closer ranges, because your beam makes a perfect circle, a perfect circumference, and the closer the object is the more intense the light is. The further you shine your light out, the bigger your circle gets and the weaker that intensity is; whereas with the Milwaukee pen light get a consistent brighter light no matter how far you shine it and you get a wider area of coverage. I can shine up my backyard pretty good with the Milwaukee light than the Coast Pen Light thats for sure.
Im glad I bought both lights to test out how I would use them when I needed too. They are both affordable and both are good lights, but out of the two, I would carry the Milwaukee everyday and leave my Coast light by my nightstand. To me, that is where the Coast Pen Light would come in handier, when you need to find something closer to you near in the dark. Now I am going to save up and purchase a bit more expensive rechargeable Streamlight Pen Light.
Another recommendation I would make is to invest in some really good rechargeable batteries, like the Panasonic Eneloop Pros and get yourself a smart charger as well, where you can make setting adjustment for your batteries and tests your batteries."

First Impressions-- Looks good out the box.  Feels solid and has good quality construction feel.  Seems like a good high quality product.

Closer Inspection and usage-  Great multi function emergency light.  This thing is awesome and has some many uses.  It uses 3 AAA batteries which are not included.  3 modes of operation -- normal flashlight, flashing side lights and a red strobe light which can be used as a emergency flare.  Not too big and fits great in the hand.  Good device to function as a simple flashlight or an emergency safety device when needed.

PROS:
---Excellent, excellent Price (well worth the money)
---Good solid quality construction body
---Bright and easy to see
---3 modes
---Hands - free operation
---Can be used as an emergency roadside flare

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I bought this for my mom, who has arthritis in her fingers and was having a lot of difficulty opening her wine bottles.  My parents have only been using it for 2 weeks now, but so far it's working very well.

There is a red LED at the top that indicates when it is charging.  Both of my parents expected this light to turn green or turn off when it was done charging, and for the first day were both concerned that the fact that it stayed red meant that it was not charging properly (and therefore would not work).  The light never turns off though, and it never changes color.. all it does is indicate when it is getting power.  I'm not sure how descriptive the manual is about this.

Also, it took a few times for my mom to realize that she doesn't have to push down on it while opening the wine bottle.  No need to press down at all.  It does require you to hold the bottle still, or else it spins the entire bottle, but you don't have to press down at all.  You just press the button and it does all the work for you.

I don't know if it will continue to work as it does right now, but if it doesn't then I'll modify my review.  So far, it's working exactly as I had hoped.

UPDATE: November 2013:
My parents still continue to use this electric wine bottle opener.  Occasionally they have some trouble getting the cork to come off the corkscrew, and since the corkscrew is sharp (as it is supposed to be), they have to be careful getting it off (my dad cut his finger on it once, but has been more careful since then).  Most of the time there is no issue.  It has definitely exceeded my expectations!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Buying an 18v drill a few years ago after doing much research I concluded that a Ryobi would suit me fine, but I have since tore the internals up.  This Milwaukee 2601 is smaller, lighter and better built.  The specs said it has more torque but I wondered if I would be able to tell the difference.  Absolutely.  I could more or less controll the Ryobi if the bit ever got stuck, but this one will twist your wrist right off.  I have to use much less effort in both drilling and driving applications, this drill does all the work.
  This milwaukee is the best in the class of compact drills with compact batteries.  This drill is a most excellent and capable tool.  It has the shortest head length of any 18v drill, it will bring 18v power to places others just can't fit.  While not being the lightest, it is the lightest to have all metal gears.  The battery lasts quite well for anything you shouldn't be using a full size maybe even hammer drill for.  A 30 min recharge time on the battery isn't the quickest, but not doing it too quickly most likely extends the battery's life.

  As to some other reviews, when considering a drill, be smart about it. Get the right tool for what you're going to be doing with it.  For anyone considering this drill, if you want a lightweight, compact yet powerful drill to reach for everytime and anytime a hammer drill isn't required, this is it.  You aren't going to be breaking into a concrete bunker with it, and it's overkill for hanging a picture but it will handle just about everything in-between."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"One of those increasingly rare ""wow, this is way better than I thought it'd be"" purchases. Barn doors are trendy and seem like a thrifty way to salvage a used door but then you go to buy the hardware and you're hit with a $300+ price tag. So, a $75 option seemed a little suspicious. But I trusted the reviews, and went for it and I'm thrilled with it.

The good:

 - The hardware is hefty and feels 'well machined'
 - it looks good. Not overly stylized so would fit in well in most rooms.
 - installed fairly easily.
 - Came with a matching door 'handle' (which while noted, was something I didn't realize initially)

The minor nit-picks

 - The roller hardware that mounts to the door isn't adjustable in or out. As such, the rollers will hang over the edge of the door a bit so the door isn't balanced on its center of gravity. Maybe this is intentional, but felt a bit off to me.
 - The instructions could have a bit more detail to them.
 - if you are installing this for a bath, note that you will have a gap between the door and frame (see below).

But, again, for $75, those are certainly nit-picks.

As for the bathroom issue, I don't think barn doors are really designed for bathrooms. In my case, I took off the top casing around the door frame and replace it with one that was twice as long. I then mounted the rail hardware to the casing (through into the wall studs, of course). After mounting the rollers and hanging, you are left with about a 5/8th of an inch gap between the door face and the casing. This can feel a bit awkward in a bathroom. I think the fix will be for me to just get clever with the door trim and fir the gap out a bit with some corner bead or the like."

It doesn't stay put and often slides out from under my cubicle (in the 1/2 in space between the cube wall and floor) into the walkway of my cube farm,  The reviews I read said this worked well on carpet, well, the model I received does not.

It has an on/off switch which you have to manually turn on and off.  With some other models I'd looked at, you turned it on, and it shut itself off after an hour or two.  Not this one.  I often forget to turn it off at the end of the day.  Not a huge problem, but something to be aware of.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"The only reason I am not giving it five stars is two reasons. One, as others have said, you have to really push the button to open the door, which causes the microwave to move around on the counter top if you don't have it backed up completely against the wall (and even then it still moves around slightly). Two, all of the front stainless steel trim and the push button door opener is a FINGERPRINT MAGNET. Other than those two minor things, it looks nice and works nice, and am glad we purchased it. I haven't tried all the features, but the sensor reheat function works great, and the defrost seems to work very nicely as well. I did find that the popcorn button did not allow for enough time to pop all the kernels, but that's really no big deal. I think that button is only for people who are so impatient that they don't want to stand there and manually listen for the popping to cease. Other than the couple of minor flaws, good looking microwave, and with 1300 watts it cooks fast, AND it's overall size is fairly compact.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This is not a 'vine review.' Dollar for dollar I do not know of a higher value than this line of meters. If you want a better one but still high value you can look for some of the Uni-t brand meters for ~$20. One caveat with these, what I call ""Harbor Freight"" meters, is that half of the meter leads are trash. You MUST test the leads. I run 1A through the lead and test the voltage across it with a known good meter. If a lead measures more than .2V at 1A it is unusable. I have seen these leads test as high as .6V at 1A. That is .6 ohm. Many of your readings will be meaningless with leads with that kind of resistance. As for the units themselves, they work quite well. I've only had one fail. The display was quite jumpy for some time. Then the readings started to drift very high before the display just went blank. I avoided these cheap meters for years because I did not think I could get a respectable product for this price, but now this is my go-to meter for when I might leave it behind or lend it out and not get it back.

French bread:1 1/3 cups Water; warm
1 1/2 tbsps olive oil
1 1/2 tsp. Salt
2 tbsps Sugar
4 cups bread flour
2 1/4 tsp. Yeast
Original recipe makes 14

servingsResize
Preparation

Place the warm water into your bread pan. Be sure the kneading paddle is in place. Then add the olive oil, the salt, and the sugar, in this order. Add the flour, covering the liguid. Make a small indentation on top of the center of the flour, but not deep enough to reach the liquid. Add the yeast to this indentation. (Adding the ingredients in this order is important, especially when using the timer. It keeps the yeast away from the liquid ingredients until it is time to knead them together. Liquid ingredients will prematurely activate the yeast.) Now you are ready to set your bread pan in the machine and set the timer or choose the French Bread Cycle. This recipe makes a 2lb loaf.

Whole WheatFor 1 1/2 lb. bread machine
1 1/4 cups water
2 tablespoons (7/8 ounce) olive or vegetable oil
1/4 cup honey or maple syrup
3 1/2 cups (14 ounces) King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat or Traditional Whole Wheat Flour
1/4 cup sunflower, sesame or flax seeds, or a combination (optional)
1 tablespoon vital wheat gluten
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast

Put all of the ingredients into the bread pan in the order listed. Program for basic white bread, and press Start.

But there are some drawbacks.  There is no headlight or height adjustment feature and this unit is difficult to push over carpets. Clean any good size room with carpets and you will feel as if you have been at the gym doing push ups.  The unit does a great job on hardwood and tile floors however and I would certainly recommend it for that.  This unit is also relatively quiet compared to my other vacumms.  You can use it without waking up everybody in the house and I like that.  You can also detach the unit from its base and carry it to clean stairs, etc.  This is not a good unit to try and clean small area rugs however as the suction is too great and it simply picks up the rug.  The handle of the unit can be adjusted up or down to fit your desire and also lifts out.  When you lift out the handle, attach the hose to it and the provided attachment, you can use it to clean higher up areas like drapes or window sills."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I purchased this rug to go underneath my writing desk in my living room. I already had the area rug and door mat. It's looks very nice. The colors are beautiful.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"I have used it 10x10 and it does the job. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it is a bit small but the plastic part does a great job of blocking out the light.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Tiny, thin, handy as can be, simple as ... uhh ... simple, and cheap enough that I bought 5 of these and gave them out to co-workers. We all would occasionally find ourselves with the need for a knife or wrench or screwdriver, but the campus where we work is a ""no weapons allowed"" kind of place, so even a Swiss Army type knife might ruffle some feathers. Taking this little thing out doesn't raise anyone's eyebrows at all, and while it's not as effective as a Leatherman or something along those lines, it's still darned handy to have for popping open boxes, prying open stuff, and so on. Shipping took quite a long time - about a month - but considering that it's coming straight from China and you're only paying ONE DOLLAR apiece for these things, it's kinda hard to really gripe much.

Only complaint: The little page of instructions that tells what is what on this tool are entirely in Chinese. No English instructions whatsoever, so you've gotta guess what does what on this thing. I Googled it and there are some pics with numbers over each spot that list the function of each thing on this. Primarily, the handiest parts are the chisel-ground ""knife"" edge, the flat screwdriver corner, the ""saw"" section, and the bottle opener, in that order. I've used a couple of the other features once or twice, but they're kind of ""meh"" details that don't mean much (to me, anyway)."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"These magnets came neatly packaged in four columns within a flat little box.  The magnets are about the size of a dime, maybe slightly bigger.  One side is plain and the other has a groove in it.  I thought only one side would stick, but it works with either side.  I mainly bought these for my mom who enjoys sticking photos to her fridge.  As a project, I laminated all her photos and then we used these magnets to stick them to the fridge.  These were strong enough to hold the one sheet of laminated photo per magnet, which worked out fine for what we needed.  However, if you were to add say two or three sheets of laminated photo, the magnets don't seem to be as strong.  These are not the strongest magnet, but they are not the weakest either.  They can hold up about three to four sheets of unlaminated photos, just to give you and understanding of their strength.  So, if your papers get too thick, these magnets will lose their magnetism."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"Only needing a CO detector in one room, I don't think these combo CO/smoke detectors are a very good idea.  (Maybe if I needed a lot of CO detectors I would, however.)  Make sure you save the directions, as well as memorize how many horn beeps there are for smoke and how many there are for carbon monoxide.  Also, the directions make it seem like there is a smoke LED and a CO LED, when there is only one for both.  In addition, you are not suppose to need to replace the batteries during the 10-year-life of the detector, since it has ""sealed, ten year lithium batteries"", yet the directions state there is a ""low battery chirp"" and tells you to install ""2 new AA batteries"" if that chirping happens?!  (Can you or can you not replace the batteries without deactivating the detector?)  Moreover, if you end up having to deactivate the detector for any reason, it becomes that week's trash.  (Only, you can't throw it in the trash.)  Finally, the directions say to test the detector once a week!  (Yeah, sure, especially if you have a lot of them.)  I don't think 10-year detectors are a good idea at all.  If you are required by law to have them, my sympathy to you.  For anyone wanting a CO detector by itself, I highly recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Alert-CO615-Dual-Power-Carbon-Monoxide-Plug-In-Alarm-with-Battery-Backup-and-Digital-Display/dp/B000Q5VMKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Alert CO615 Dual Power Carbon Monoxide Plug-In Alarm with Battery Backup and Digital Display</a>, and there are plenty of decent smoke detectors out there that don't last 10 years.

Forney promises that this will do just as well...... my best guess based upon previous Forney products used is that it will be equal, or very likely,.... a bit better than the expensive stuff.

Both were priced well and both had the Edison rebate which had swallowing the mid $200 device much easier. I ended up going with the Ecobee for a few reasons.

1. There was a return unit being sold thru Amazon Warehouse deals. I guess this was a return for some reason.
2. This unit included a wireless unit that I could put in my master bedroom to monitor the temp in there.

Actually I have come to own a digital thermostat because when we went on vacation over the summer weekend, I forgot to turn off the AC and it ran on the hottest days. That was a lesson learned. I won't be having that issue anymore.

There was some work to be had during the installation as I had to access my furnace in my attic to tap into the main wire set. The Ecobee does not run on batteries so it needed to have an extra module hard wired in. It was difficult but just difficult getting around my attic.

Thermostat works like a charm. No issues and I got lucky with the used item. All is well."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"I am changing my review (shown below). This item is poorly made. After wearing to sleep at night over a 2 week period, it sprung a major leak. I awoke to find my head covered in little white beads. I contacted and returned to Amazon. They sent me another. After 2 weeks, this one is starting to leak. The inner lining is a very poor thin cloth which does not last. Also, the side holes serve no purpose in a wrap around sleep mask.

Unlike some reviews, this is a serious review. It is very comfortable and fits completely over the head. There is a hole in front which will fit leaving my nose and mouth uncovered but covering my eyes. it does reduce sound but does not completely eliminate it. It is not hot. It does not require any straps  for adjustment. Simply pull it on and adjust so that the eyes are covered leaving the mouth and nose open.

I have them on my ceiling fan and they work great.

I love the color, the light, and the motion sensor. I will probably buy another one to replace it. The only reason I didn't buy it was because of the price. It's not nearly as good as the original one. I just wanted a larger light, and the Schlage 32-60-8 is not as good. I'll be ordering another one.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Initially bough this kettle for use downstairs in our wet bar while guests were visiting.

Now with all the guests gone, we've brought it upstairs to replace our rusting Kitchen Aid stove-top kettle.

I love how quickly it heats, even when full, and is super handy when I want to quickly heat small amounts of water.

I've had no construction issues with the kettle in the 2 months we've owned it.

The one annoying design issue I had (which is more user err than anything) pertains to the location of the 'on' light.

I'd plugged the kettle in with the handle facing me and hit the on switch but saw nothing indicate it was on. I was like a monkey trying to figure out why the darn thing would turn on...then I realized the light was on the side of the kettle I could see.

'On' light should be by 'on/off' switch.

Overall, good product."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I don't have sleep apnea, but I sometimes snore at night. In addition to using nasal strips, I purchased this made-in-America SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW to help cut down on my snoring. As the name suggests, this pillow isn't a traditional shaped pillow and is contoured. Depending on how you place the pillow, one of the bumps is larger than the other one. This is not a full gel pillow or a full memory foam pillow. Instead, this pillow is mostly composed of memory foam that is covered in a layer of gel foam.

I have used this pillow for about six months. It has helped cut down on the snoring I do at night. In terms of comfort, the SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW is usually a pretty comfortable pillow. However, occasionally there are times when I find the contour shape to be uncomfortable, such as when I was sick or when I have had a very busy and stressful day at work and my neck is already sore.

Overall, the SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW is a comfortable and relaxing pillow. Just be aware that its not 100% memory foam or gel foam."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Ok so the trickiest step was step one.
the hardest step was step four
the most annoying step was assembling the drawers.

They said you would need two people to assemble it but i did it by myself. Let me tell you something, if you are stubborn enough or skilled enough or have the right tools you can do just about anything. I didn't have the right tools so i will let you guys decide on whether i am stuborn or skilled.

Assembly took about 2 hours. The piece, once assembled, is very solid. I expect many many years of use from this. The casters are also very nice too and the whole thing rolls with ease even when you add weight.

Why four stars. Well it is a series of small details. Some of the shelf pin holes are too big and the shelf pins just fall out. One of the door panels was build with the dark color facing out and the other with the dark color facing in. but probably the work part is that some of the pieces are warped.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"All in all, it's a decent blade, gets the job done - cuts aluminum. It came nicely packaged in thick cardboard ""sleeve"", with clear tubing protecting the teeth. 5 stars for packaging.
At my place, it will be used now and then for thin aluminum angle and strips.
Cuts are not clean, I have to use a file to clean them up and smooth the edges. Were I a professional, this would have been unacceptable, but since I am not, I can live with it (for a while, till perfectionism gets the best of me).
In the past I've used one much more expensive aluminum-cutting blade. We're talking close to $100, and smaller diameter (between 7"" and 8"" -can't remember exactly). Now, THAT blade... The resulting cuts were immaculate, smooth-edged and shiny (not dull and ""barbed"" as with the blade being reviewed), and did not require any further finishing work.

THE BOTTOM LINE:
If you're a hobbyist like me, needing to make a dozen cuts once in a blue moon, then save your money and get it.
If you're a professional, invest into something of better quality."

I currently have a wooden Lime & Lemon squeezer. That one is great for certain things that needs a bit of pulp of the Lime & Lemon. What I don't have is one of these Heavy Duty Lime & Lemon squeezer. This one has some weight to it and feels very strong in your hands. I like that there is 2 different bowl design. One for the Lime, since limes are smaller than the Lemon. And the other bowl for the Lemon. For some people, that is just extra work and troublesome when using it. I find it very useful and smart that they also made to color coded to match.

Now to use this properly, you MUST place the Lime or Lemon with the expose side, facing DOWN. This is how the squeezer works by pushing the Lime or Lemon down, causing it to flip inside out, so the juice can come out to the bottom of the squeezer. I know it looks like you should place the Lime or Lemon with the expose side facing up to match the squeezers shape but that will not work and Lime or Lemon juice will splash everywhere and there won't be that many juice coming out of it.

The Stockman model gives you 3 good blades of varying size and shape.  The large version weighs an ounce and a half more than the medium size and is 5/8 of an inch longer.  The additional size and weight can pull your pocket out of shape.  The amber bone  has an excellent hand feel and is a joy to hold. The blades are very sharp. Stainless steel will require less care to keep rust away but still hold a good edge.
A Case knife is a possession to be treasured that will be with you for years. Case is an investment in a quality knife that will become a life-long friend.  In a world of cheaply made knives from overseas, American made Case is a beacon of quality. For over one hundred years, this company produced quality knives.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I added one of these hardwired Kidde/Firex CO alarms in our basement in the general area of the oil burner just in case there is ever a problem with flue gasses backing up. I have it interconnected with two other KN-COB-IC carbon monoxide alarms and four Kidde/Firex SA320CN Dual-Sensor smoke alarms located throughout the rest of the house. This CO alarm has a 9v battery backup in case of power interruption and will sound along with the other interconnected CO alarms when one of them detects a high CO level. It has its own distinct sound pattern to differentiate it from the sound the smoke alarms make. However, this CO alarm is apparently designed so that it will not also sound the interconnected smoke alarms, which would mean if you only had one of these CO alarms installed in a remote location of your home, like a basement, it may not be able to alert people in other areas of the building when it activates. So, the ideal solution would be to have one of these interconnected CO alarms on each floor in addition to smoke alarms. The alarm has a built in end of life notification feature that alerts you when it needs replacement with two chirps every 30-seconds. The Amazon product description above says this occurs after seven years of operation, but the actual User's Guide that came with it says ten years, so not sure which is correct. Overall, this CO alarm seems decently made and was fairly reasonably priced. Of course I hope to never actually have it activate from high CO levels in our home, but it's good to know it is there just in case.

Update: According to Kidde's website, the KN-COB-IC carbon monoxide alarms manufactured as of 2013 now have a 10-year end of life cycle, not 7-years as indicated in the product description above."

I have several locations and have never had an issue, to date. I hear the Ecobee works better too, but these Nests are a joke. The Radio Thermostat does not have the ""sensing away"" capability, but that is one of many things that will not work well on the Nest you paid $250 for."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Holy COW!  IT WORKS!!!  Nothing sticks to Tarps, EVER, and it never ever lasts, but someone made a deal for their soul and behold!  We have TARP TAPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Truthfully, here is my story.

I like Burning Man because the climate tries to kill you (and other reasons.)  A HUGE, CRAZY STORM CAME AND FILLETED MY SHELTER!!  It struck from three directions and damaged every single tent in its vicinity, toppled pop-up campers and shredded the mylar off the tarp base in my roof.  It knocked over entire rows of porta-potties and left me sleeping in my car for days because it filled my shelter with mud and the roof (a tarp) was split.

My conundrum was severe.  The restoration was going to have to happen, should I ever not sleep in my car again, and so I evaluated the tarp tape and hoped it would do the job.  I did a sloppy job of cleaning off the surfaces and I started reattaching the mylar to the tarp with the tarp tape.  I used sutures and long stretches of tape to repair the splits and make the roof look like a relative of Frankenstein.  I didn't think it would last one day, but it survived for two weeks in the desert, through another rain storm and many hot days.  It didn't peel.  It didn't bubble up under the sun or slide like some tapes will when they overheat.  It just held strong.

I'm in love."

I bought this unit to replace a competitor's unit that suffered a bearing failure after 2 weeks of service.  The original radon fan from this same competitor had been in service for 22 years.  Now, I don't think there is any real difference between this unit and the one that failed--they sure look similar--I think it was just bad luck with the first one.  But I wasn't prepared to  replace the failed unit with the same model so I ordered this one which has been working well so far.

I use them to pour coffee beans or tea into bowls, it doesn't matter if you have a hot water pitcher or a hot water pitcher. I love the color, the color is not as bright as I was expecting it to be, but I really like the color of the bowls. I love the fact that the bowls have a handle that doesn't slide off the bottom of the bowl. This allows you to just pour coffee or tea into the bowl with ease. I don't like that I have to push the handle to push out the water and it keeps the water from getting too hot."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"I confess I'm an early adopter and the lure of the video for Kevo where doors open at a touch was too much to resist.

The lock is a total failure. The iPhone has to have the app open or it doesn't work, the lock locks arbitrarily, often after I use the key to get in and it locks as I'm closing it (sending the bolt into the doorframe)
When it does work the mechanism is so slow that I would never want to be trying to get into the house in a panic situation.
I have calibrated and re-calibrated,  all to no avail.
I hear Schlage's bluetooth lock is better, but I probably won't invest in that one either now.
Too bad."

And the Zoopolr tire levers and worth every penny of the $10.00. Start by clamping the tire in 3 places, then start ""inching"" the tire onto the wheel using the tire irons.

Yes, it takes a while.  I haven't timed it.  It's not burdensome.  You can walk around while you grind.  The directions are in English.  A helpful hint is to hold the handle in place while adjusting the grind.  Counterclockwise for coarse.  Pinch a bit of coffee and you'll see that the beans are evenly ground.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I was looking for some sturdy, good quality stainless pots and pans, but I couldn't afford the all-clads. I did a lot of research, and I came across this set. I even saw some of the pots on America's Test Kitchen saying that they were their top cheap choice for pots.

I knew that some people complained about discoloration when cooking, well, I found out that most stainless will discolor with normal use. I have indeed had my pots discolor if I do not clean them properly (chore-boy) or if I have cooked something for a really long time in them. In my experience, I learned that if there is anything stuck to the pans, boil water in them and it will take off just about anything. Also, if they do discolor, that will usually go away after I use them again.

As far as the whole eggs stick thing, yes they will. You have to lower your stove temp considerably to cook delicate things as the aluminum core really heats up well. Also, learn how to cook in stainless. That means look it up on the net etc until you are used to them. It takes some time and some burnt food in the meantime until you get the hang of it, especially coming from non-stick. Also, butter isn't the best for keeping food from sticking. Smart balance or pam works the best.

Really, I have been able to cook some great things that I couldn't cook easily with my old set. First of all, these can go into the oven and the dishwasher, two benefits over my old set. Also, I get a much better browning on meats and other foods with this set.

Overall, I really like this set a lot. I would eventually like all-clad, but for less than the cost of a single pan, I got the whole set of Cuisinart. I think it worked out well."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"I have been using these lights for the last 10 years. I have a yellowish-white light that I had to replace, but since then, I have had great success with these. I have been in the field for several years now and I always have the same thoughts about lighting up my yard or taking the steps I want to be able to take. These lights are awesome."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"My only complaint is that the case it comes in is pretty simple plastic, so the pieces always fall out when you try to open/shut it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Product is of fine craftsmanship.  Sturdy and attractive and substantial.  Delivery was prompt.  I'd buy another if needed.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"An AWESOME!!!  I love the look and feel of this pillow. I have one in my bathroom and the other in a closet. The pillow is a nice, strong, thick, deep blue color. It is a perfect size for my needs and is comfortable. The pillow is soft and plush and I love the color. I can't wait to try out the color options.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.I have a few different types of knives, but I can't find a single one that I use as much as this one. It does a great job of slicing through steak, it is a good knife for slicing bread, it is a good knife for slicing a large amount of meat, and it is well made. It is very easy to use and clean, and the handle is a nice touch. The only negative thing is the handle is a little loose. I don't like it very"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"I received this tool as a gift. It is well made and very useful, especially with trim molding and almost anything that requires an angle on the sliding miter saw. However, the scale was misaligned by one full degree. I called Starrett and was told that their tolerance for this tool is +/- one degree. That is unacceptable from a company like Starrett renowned for their  precision. I exchanged the tool for another, hand selected from inventory, and found one just .1 degree misaligned after looking at a dozen or so. This is workable accuracy but IMO the tool should be engraved, and the scale should be accurate or the scale should be eliminated. The decal itself may be accurate but the application process seems to produce a fair number of these tools with misaligned scales. With a sliding miter saw this is not really a problem as you can just transfer the angle. But, if the scale is there it should be accurate or at least installed properly. With the scale accuracy problems it rates three stars. If the scale were properly installed and accurate, I would give it 5 stars. Then I would not have to use my engraved Starrett protractor to read the actual angle when needed."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,These lights add a nice warm accent to my bedroom.  I wrapped them around the canopy posts of my bed and it looks very inviting and calming.  They are bright enough but not so bright that it is hard to look at.  They don't seem to heat up too hot although I don't check that very often since they are up so high.  They just add a lovely feature to my room that lights it with a warm tone that seems to make everything else in my room look nicer than it really is so I always have them on if guests come over!

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,May daughter wanted some holiday style lighting to decorate her dorm room at college.  But she didn't want that typical holiday light.  These look so cute in her dorm room.  She is thrilled with them.  Happy with the purchase.  And three months later they seem to be fine with no bulbs out.

My interface with customer service prior to purchase was very informative. Their web site makes it very easy to work with. Setting up the remote sensors, I bought the 2 xtra pack in addition to the main unit, was extremely simple. Actually they set themselves up which was amazing. Ecobee3 knocks the competition out of the house."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Excellent rework station. I highly recommend it. The extra tips and spares are a very thoughtful addition. My only critique is the plastic iron holder, I would pay a little more for this product for a metal iron holder but this is not enough of an issue to knock a star off. Update - purchased a 2nd one for another bench. Excellent product."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,Very light weight and nice. It is somewhat hard to coil up even after stretching it quite a bit.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I am so pleased with the ODOR Absorbed Activated Charcoal NATURAL Deodorizer Bag by UBERPAKK. In the past the only option I thought I had was placing one of those charcoal tubs in my bathroom or closet which works pretty well but doesn't look nice at all. This will eliminate the odors and yet be non-imposing on my decor or be forgotten in my closet.

I put one of these right smack dab on the top of the tank of my toilet of my guest bathroom which is only used when we have guests. It goes great in there and also looks very decorative. (So much better than having the charcoal tub sitting on the floor). I put the other one in a guest room closet. I really hate going in one of my rooms, opening up a closet and it smelling musty. Now, it never will. I hung it on a hanger and it can be seen by anyone who hangs their clothes in there. It just looks nice. The muted green goes with any room in my house so I am certain that I will be ordering more before too long.

I was fortunate to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my HONEST & UNBIASED opinion. I ALWAYS pretest every product prior to writing a review. I am free to write whatever I believe to be true, whether positive or negative. This is my true story and my honest opinion."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"The immersion blender itself is quite nice.  I like the adjustable speed - you can use a lower speed when blending in a smaller vessel.  But the accessories are terrible.  My plastic beaker leaks.  I know - hard to imagine a plastic beaker leaking, but sure enough this one drips out the bottom.  And the chopper attachment has no bearings there so it makes a shrieking sound when it runs.  I suppose it'll probably be quieter if you chop oily foods, but i was mixing dry ingredients.  I was actually trying to grind spices and found the blade too dull for that.  Probably not what it's meant for, so i can't blame the tool for that one."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Totally took care of our needs. We used it for a 55"". Pretty easy to assemble and gets the job done!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,"These are very useful when working on the wall.  I also love that they have a one-touch switch.  The switch is easy to use, and the cover is very sturdy.  The bulb is smaller than the standard fluorescent bulbs.  This one is still very bright.  I have used it with a portable light, which is great for a small area.  I will probably buy another one with a touch switch.Great.  I like that the spring is spring loaded and that the light stays on the wall.  I love that it is bright.  This light is super bright and has a good balance of light and motion.  I have to say that I like the color and the color is nice.  It is bright and bright.  I had a few issues with it, but the only one I have was that I had to turn it off and on a little bit to get it to stay on."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Die Dog Hair....Die!!!!
Around Christmas time we were expecting guests... I pulled out my vacuum and nothing. Sometime in the last few months of neglect it had expired. RIP... I still had guests coming. I live in the middle of national forest. Think, Big trees, bears, dirt, dirt and more dirt. Naturally I didn't have the time to drive the 140+ miles round trip to go to a town that has a stop light and a walmart. So what did I do I went to our local (only 30 miles away) hardware store. They carry two vacuums, not a lot of choice, but apparently there is a reason they only carry two. They work!  The Eureka was the more expensive of the two by about $20.00 But I liked the rewinding cord feature so I got it and went along home. Put it together and started vacuuming the cabin, let me tell you, it was amazing. Carpet that I had been thinking of replacing took on new life, the attachments were easy to use. Of all the silly things I was having FUN vacuuming. No really, it's true. BUT THE BEST PART was how it handled the dog hair in my home. I have two large golden retrievers, They are serious about their shedding. I truly believe that they think it's a career opportunity. They take it that seriously. This thing sucked it up along the base boards, under the beds off of the log walls and out of the couch cushions and not once did it clog up. I wish it had another attachment extension but other than that it's a well designed machine. My only other suggestion for improvement would be to come out with a ride-um-model with a cup holder."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"It does make some good french fries, but it does not seem to provide the same heat for frying that requires a higher heat, as your stove. It gets to a max of 375F and takes about 8 minutes. Appreciate that the product has a magnetic cord for safety. As a tip, don't dump frozen fries directly into this fryer to avoid splatter. I throw it in the air fryer to dry out the moisture for 5-6 minutes and then deep fry it, and it comes out well."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,I bought this to use on a professional project and it works great.  The yellow coated one is a little too yellow for the most typical area but the light is so bright it's nice to have.  It's a little pricey for a flashlight but I don't think

I would definitely buy this again.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I was very disappointed. It's not very sharp, but it's nice to have a little bit of a sharper edge on your knives. It's very easy to clean and holds a lot of knives, so I would highly recommend it.  I was just looking for a nice, sturdy knife. I have used it a couple of times, and it's still working fine. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality knife. I've had no problems with this knife. I have used it for almost a month now. I've used it a lot, and it's not really the sharpest edge. It's just a little sharper than the one I had before. The other one I have is a little less sharp, but I would say it's still great for cutting very sharp fruit. I would also say that it's very comfortable for me.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"This light really packs the punch. The wide beam is good enough to make a small room look like a room. The dimmer feature is also great, if you don't mind having a dimmer. It's not a large beam, but it is very bright. If you have a large room, it's a great option. The light is very well built and well made. I wish I had known about it before I bought it.It's an old fashioned, classy, and pretty. I love it. The color is a little too warm for my tastes. I'm a little concerned about it being a good price, but it's worth it. We bought a new lamp and I like it. I'm using it for an indoor bathroom and it's not going to warm up. I wish it had a little more light, but I haven't found any.Works great on my Milwaukee. I have a 6 footer and a 25 footer. The 18 inch drill bit"

I can see the seller's dilemma, though.  There are spotlights and then there are spotlights.  This is a spotlight with six little LEDs, and so I suppose they assumed too much of us.  Don't buy this expecting to become an EquiSearch volunteer.  Buy it to set up some interesting lighting effects in your home."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"The machining is crude; running a fingernail down the edges isn't necessary as one person said; just look at it closely.  However, for any homeowner-type job it's likely to be used for, I think it would be perfectly fine and I have no intention of returning it.  As to the loose handle, a pair of #47 O-rings (AS-568 #009), easily available at any hardware or home improvement store, will give you the ability to remove the handle as needed, or use it in any position along it's length without falling out - a feature I like."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Works perfectly. I just rec'd and used this for the first time. I actually bought two of them, one for me and one for my daughter overseas. I don't own a big machine, but I wanted to try this. I didn't have an issue with the little slit in the valve."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"I mean. it's Klein. what more do you need?  Klein is a great brand for a reason!  I bought two of these to replace a defective switch in my shop, so it was a nice surprise. The original switch worked fine, but one of the two bulbs died within a couple of weeks. I ended up going back to the original switch and having to replace the second one. I went to Home Depot and found it to be too expensive and a good deal for the time it took to replace one of the bulbs. I returned it and ordered another one. When it arrived it was a little different. The switch has a tiny plastic cap attached to the bottom of the switch and the light is attached to the top of the switch. I had to carefully pull the cap off the light, but it was easy enough."

I wish I had had gotten it a little earlier, but it's still a good product. I'd definitely recommend this item. I bought this as a gift for my son who loves to read books and has always loved to read books. It is a nice size for a small toddler and I like the color and the fact that it has a short handle to hold the book. I will be buying another one for my daughter as she is a bit of a book sleeper. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. These are really nice quality sheets. They are made of polyester and they are made of a lightweight material.

For example, I'm mostly going to be using it for wood carving. There are only a couple wood carving pieces in this entire kit, so a lot of it will most likely not be used. May behoove some folks to purchase the Dremel itself, and then purchase your bits separate, may save you some cash and give you a better selection of things you really need."

I contacted Amazon to verify that they were doing the right thing and they sent me a new one. I'm going to order another one, which I will try to return.

Although I do not have a baby currently in my household, I do have a toddler and I have put this to good use with her. She can get hot at night and end up sweating terribly. This sits on the dresser in our room beings we still co-sleep. Hey, don't judge! Not only does she benefit from this but it instantly tells me the temperature in the mornings so I know what to wear. Same goes with my oldest daughter.

I love the color association part of it. It's not like your normal night light where it's just a light and shows you nothing. It's also not bothersome to sleep. It glows just enough that you can tell it's there but it's not bright in any way.

It's convenient in the sense that you can charge it and it lasts for 72 hours before needing to be charged again. It's portable once it's charged which is a plus. Just keep a power bank with you on long trips and voila!

I am in the early stages of teaching my toddler the association between hot and cold. This night light is something that I know will help her along with learning what cold is and what hot is. She already loves looking at it and holding it.

I also really look forward to using this for a baby that may come along in the future. As a mom of 2, I have confidence in this night light for so many reasons. Definitely worth purchasing for yourself, a new mom, as a baby shower gift, housewarming gift or even Christmas gift.

I received this product for free or at a discounted price in exchange for a review on my blog."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Love it! Love the size, have it over tv with a dark blue night-light bulb inside (looks aqua when reflected through the white star). Will eventually put in a changing light. Placed cord side on bottom and hung with few laps of clear jewelry thread around star and tied at top for a loop."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This bottle is soooooo Pretty !!  And, you can't lose it because there are not too many items with this color...."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Good price and they look lovely on my windows.  I've gotten many compliments.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,"This saw is one of the best I've ever owned.  I have a variety of tools.  The range is amazing.  I have used the T8 Spyderco saw for years and it still holds up to every use.  I have several other saws and have found the T8 Spyderco to be very reliable and reliable.  I have had this saw for over a year and it still holds up to every use.  I have never had a problem with it.  I highly recommend this saw.  I will definitely buy it again.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"not awful, but forget the word. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I just can't get the burlap out of the bottom of the plastic bag. The burlap is just a little hard to get out, but it is fine. I don't know how long the bag will last, but I will keep buying the burlap"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,Excellent shooting glasses and excellent quality. The only problem is that it's not really a bright one.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"This keeps the garage tidy by keeping the bikes upright. But it doesn't fit bikes with disc brakes very well. Just a little more room, a dip in the bar, whatever, would have made these much better to not mess up my discs. Aside from that, assembly was easy, and it seems very sturdy and durable."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"nice set of bungies, good heavy clips on the ends."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,This product performs well and looks great in the kitchen. I will keep my shelves in order and use them for extra storage. I am very happy with the purchase.This is a great fan. It is quiet and does a great job of keeping the water cool. I have had no issues with it. I have also had it for several years and have not had any issues with the fan. I would recommend it to anyone.We love these containers. They fit well in our home and we have them on the floor next to our baking sheets. They are very well
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,not ideal. the screw that hold the blade is cheap and can't be properly tightened.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This is a good product, although I did find that sometimes it darkens one side more than the other. I would recommend it."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Works great.  I have wanted an angle grinder for a while now, and our concrete sidewalk project helped make it so.  Highly recommend, especially since it comes with a case.  The way I figure... The best way to keep your tools clean is to put them in the case before you store them away!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Nice product.  I bought expensive benjamin Moore paint.  I put XIM paint extender into it.  It came out beautifully.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Well built piece of necessary equipment if one needs to plumb a door level ductwork etc. I should have bought the 5 point laser.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,My new bed has bedsprings that are more comfortable than my old one.  The dimensions are just right.  The bed is very comfortable.  The pillowcases are a great size and the color is beautiful.  I would definitely buy this
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,These are adorable for my little ones and they look great too.  These work well and look great.  Great for emergencies.These are perfect for the job I'm doing.  The color temperature is perfect and the light is perfect for working on the bench.  I would definitely buy again.I love these lights!  I have had them for a few years now and they are awesome.  I have tried to keep them on my desk
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I've had one of these for years and I want to get at least one more.  I haven't been able to find them in home improvement stores lately.  You can mount this clamp anywhere on your work bench by simply drilling a hole for the supplied round headed bolt and then countersinking for the bolt head.  When the clamp is not in use the bolt will then drop flush with the work surface.  There's no open hole in the work bench like for a hold fast.  When you want to use it you simply reach under the work surface, push up on the bolt, slide the clamp onto the bolt head and clamp down your piece.  And you can make additional bolts to mount the same clamp at different places simply by rounding the hex head on an ordinary bolt using a grinder.  It's very handy for planing, sanding or any other reason you may want to clamp a piece down away from the edge of your bench.  And if you know the brand you know their tools are well made - American made by the way."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Used this in a recently renovated bathroom.  Didn't realize how expensive the accessories were. Searched Amazon and found this product.  It was attractive, solid and inexpensive.  I would recommend."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These are very nicely made. These are not originals, they are reprints which I believe is in the description. These are about 12"" square, with hangers already applied to the backs.
Disclaimer I received this set of 4 sea canvases at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,What rod fine. Very flimsy so I have to hold it precariously to even fill it with water
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"I've been a Streamlight fan for a long time and these are a nice little light. I'm using them for painting the front of my office and then for lighting up the side of my office. They are great for reading, reading a book, or reading with friends. They also have a wide range of colors to choose from. I'm very happy with the quality and quality of the product. I would buy these again.This is an excellent product. I have two of these around my house. I would recommend this product.I bought these to replace my old version of the LED bulbs that were always on.  These are very bright, and the included charger is very handy.  I use them on my new 5 watt fluorescent lamp, and they work well.  I had a few issues with the product, but it worked"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This was a great investment. Kept all salads cold during the day and did not take up alot of room like using a baby pool would.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Excellent, the grill looks very nice. The only problem is that it's not really a vacuum,"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Lighting can set the mood, whether you want a relaxing atmosphere or and exciting one, lighting can be used to create it. I received the Ohuhu Ocean Wave LED Light Projector and Speaker to review and it is wild!
This is more than an average light changing lamp. A small disc over the 12 LED lights moves while projecting the light through the 5 1/4 inch rippled lens, creating wonderful, ever-changing waves across the ceiling, wall or any surface it is aimed towards.
The patterns and colors are mesmerizing! The push of a button takes you to the next color. There are 8 different color patterns taking you from a multi pattern to red, to blue to green. Pick one that fits you mood.
This lighted orb also contains a speaker and an input to plug in your mp3 player, computer, your phone, etc so you can enjoy your music at the same time.
The projector can be operated off a wall outlet via the included outlet adapter or it can be operated off a USB device. You can take this almost anywhere to enjoy the hypnotic waves of color. It automatically turns off after an hour. I do wish there was a switch to deactivate the auto off for times when you want it to stay on longer. It's not that big of a deal to push the button to turn it back on though.
I love just turning off the light and having this cast waves over the ceiling and walls while watching TV or working on the computer. It gives me a tranquil feeling that calms me and lets my mind relax a little.
This lamp is great in the living room, bedroom or even a kid's room. You can experience the tranquil waves of color from the Ocean Waves Projector by scooting over to Amazon. Flood your room with color!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"We now have two of these, and two of the smaller ones. They're perfect for packing grapes, sandwiches, chips, and crackers. Some of the negative reviews about it not being water-tight seem a little silly as messy things shouldn't be packed for lunches or outings. We use these not only for school lunches, but also when we go to amusement parks, or any outing that will last most of the day."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I absolutely love this inexpensive, functional, and very comfortable pillow. I have a large one and a small one. I am very happy with the purchase. This is a great fan. It is quiet and does a great job of keeping the water cool. I have had no issues with it. I have also had it for several years and have had no problems with it. I have had no problems with it falling over or anything."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I'm surprised by the bad reviews. The quality is good but it's not really the best one.I bought this for a friend, she loves it!I bought this for my daughter's room.  It is a good size for her size.  I use it to hold her clothes and a lot of things.  I also use it to store a lot of clothes.  I love the fact that it has a nice depth to it.  It is well made and does not slip or crack.  I have no complaints about it, it is very well made and it is a great price."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Bought several of these to replace a broken one on my RV.  These work well and look great.  Great price!Works great.  The light is a little brighter than it should be.  It's not a large beam, but"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,Love these gloves....all versions of this will work fine.  I will keep them in the glove box.I bought this item to replace a defective switch in
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,CG,alligator clips fall off pretty easily. The only reason I didn't give this a 4 star is
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Looks to be well made. I love the look. The blade is a little large, but is well made."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"kind of cheap, really thin metal, does the trick.
Exactly what youd expect for $1.99."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Great product, we live out in the country and have no city lights. For our dog that we allow to run off leash this works great. We can see him as would our neighbors be able to if he got into the road. The battery life is good but not awesome."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Good inexpensive tape - was imported from China - I consider tape measures to be consumable so no issues have used this for a while and its showing its age as expected - would recommend.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Good product for value. I washed it in our (newer GE model) top load washing machine with agitator in cold water. I was a little confused when it said wash at 140 F - like was it required that I washed it at that temp? I know it sounds ridiculous, but I was confused. I washed it in cold water and it was completely fine. I also dried on the low heat setting in our dryer and it was completely fine as well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"This is a piece of cake. The pieces are just what I wanted for my kitchen.  The bottom is not the best but it is perfect for the price.This is a great fan. It is quiet and does a great job of keeping the water cool. I have had no issues with it. I have also had it for several years. I am very happy with this purchase. I just wish there was a way to remove the metal covering. I will buy another one.I got this for my son's old house.  He loved it and it was great!  We have been using it daily for several weeks now and it has worked perfectly.  It is a very good size for his small bedroom, but I would recommend it to anyone.Very nice for the price.  Love it!Easy to clean.Love the design of this pan.  We use it on our sink and it cleans up easily.  I would recommend.My daughter loves this pillow. She loves that it is made of polyester."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,Used these for years in my house and they work just fine.  These work well and the extra light is great. 
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"You know how good they are. Make sure you have a tool made for crimping these--it will make your connections easier, quicker, and more secure."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,CG,this unit requires lots of time to assemble and re-install. This unit is built with a self-healing mechanism.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Great for a playroom with multiple children. It fits a bit of everyone's favorite.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Pros: pretty easy to install, delivers a nice stream of water, good spray pressure, feels sturdy after install, can do the handle left or right, color I wanted. Cons: almost returned because its super tall and clunky looking (not rustic, but not refined), the pull down nozzle does not pull out or retract very smoothly, the pull down nozzle does not set back in place without being very deliberate. I did way too much research and found that most pull down faucets have issues, so I had lowered expectations. I thought I might regret switching from a decent regular kitchen faucet to an arch with a pull down - but it is a very good change. Thought the soap dispenser might be a disappointment - but its been great and super easy to refill. There aren't too many black faucets available currently - I really like black or oil rubbed brass, but oil rubbed bronze is popular right now, which I don't like.
UPDATE: 11/17 have had this 2.5 yrs now, the finish is still nice, but the pull out doesn't always want to stay in place, which is a bit of a bummer, also the switch between stream and spray sticks."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"They are good quality and I think the price was a good deal. I also like the new hex key adjustment built into the thumbscrew. A couple of things worried me a little. The 10"" strait jaw and long nose pliers have a bit of play, side-to-side, in the jaw and they don't necessarily align perfectly when you close them; there is no play at all when they are closed. I'm not sure this really even matters, but it bothers me. On the other hand, I'm not sure I've ever seen long nose locking pliers, old or new, that didn't have a little wobble in the open jaw.
All of the curved jaw pliers are fine, so I'm giving them  a four over the two loose jaws."
