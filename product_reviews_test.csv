Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Our house came with an older Moen tub faucet that had been well-used. I bought this handle kit and a chrome escutcheon to dress it up. The handle came with a plastic adapter to attach it to the original cartridge, since the plastic knob has a horizontal screw holding it on, while this metal handle uses a vertical set-screw.
It all went together easily, but I had to disassemble and reassemble it a few times to get it working properly. The plastic adapter has a neat little assembly to restrict rotation, but possibly due to our setup, it wasn't long enough to stay in the stop tube. In other words, the water turned on fine, but then couldn't be shut off.
After removing a piece, the adapter and metal handle have been working fine, though I still feel a lot of slop in the connection. About an inch of the stop tube is exposed now, which doesn't look quite right, but again, I think it's due to our setup. I don't want to tear out the tub surround and replumb entire thing. If you're replacing a knob with this kit, just be aware it may not look quite as good as a new faucet. However, the price difference is substantial."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"So all my life I've been cooking with wooden spoons so I don't ding up the metal pots (nylon spoons warp and melt - hate them). I'm also a dishwasher kind of gal, hate doing dishes by hand. When I found out that these wooden spoons can go straight in the dishwasher I was like ""is that even possible?!"" In addition, I have the Epicurean cutting boards and love them (also stick them in the dishwasher!). So we got these Epicurean spoons and I'm ready to throw all other cooking utensils away. I'm so glad they come as a pack of 3 because I use them daily when cooking. I'm also the type of gal that leaves a spoon in a pot and walks away to do another task in the kitchen (I ruin a lot of good spatulas that way); these spoons can withhold the high heats while left in the pan.

There are 3 different utensils it comes with. My fiance loves the flat straight edge one for cooking ground beef to separate the meat. I equally love the small and large spoon. The smaller spoon is like your typical thought of a wooden spoon and the large spoon is large but still usable like the smaller spoon, I use them interchangeably. The great news is they don't change the flavor or my cooking or retain any smells/flavors (I also sniff my dishes when they come out the dishwasher).

I think I'm going to get everyone this for Christmas. You don't have to cook with your momma's wooden spoons now! Great for dishwasher fans or a change to the typical wooden spoon."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"Installation should be a fairly easy matter if you are replacing compatible hardware.
BUT, if you're replacing Weiser deadbolts, you may be out of luck.
That's what I discovered when I tried to install the Kwikset Smartcode 915 on our front door. I struggled mightily for a couple of hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong before I finally concluded that when the contractor who built my house installed the Weiser deadbolts, it involved drilling a hole for the latch mechanism just a smidge too low to match up with the Kwikset hardware. It's close, maddeningly close, but there is no way I could make it work.
Just to be sure, I attempted to install the Kwikset deadbolt on a similar door connecting our back hallway with the garage. And the result was exactly the same.
If I want to use the Kwikset hardware, I'll have to enlarge one of the two holes in the door - the one for the latch or the one for the locking mechanism. Or, I suppose, I could buy a new door and start from scratch. None of these options seem worth the effort.
Other than the fact that I can't readily install it, this is a very cool product and I was looking forward to having it on my front door.
I'll hang onto it in case I find a compatible door someday, but buyers should be aware that it's not an easy replacement for Weiser deadbolts."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This vac works really well, but there is a flaw with the handle in that the unit is not balanced well and tips over breaking the handle.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"A LED light in the $5 to $7 range that works as well as this one has to be worth some kind of gold star. I replaced an 6 volt Xenon Lantern with one of these only it works better - much.
I 100% totally don't understand the people spending huge amounts of time finding fault with a device like this and my reaction is - get a life. These things are flashlights or devices that I - a retired electronics engineer don't see how they can build at this price point much less how good and solid they really are and how well they actually work.
Under no circumstances would I mount one on a Picatinny Rail Mount (even if it fit), or other life/death applications but - me I just need a flashlight.

Yesterday, my husband was on his elliptical and a bolt landed on the floor. He could not find where it came from but, with the Halo light, I found where it came from in about 2 minutes.

It has been great to have on hand for spreading out large / odd shaped oversized plugs/transformer blocks and for splitting UPS outlets to be able to plug in several small devices.  Only downside is also its positive - the product is heavy weight plus a bit bulky so it makes packing it in my laptop bag (for when traveling and a hotel or airport doesn't have enough outlets) a bit much.  Also, in other uses, it can be a bit hard to cable manage all of the transformer blocks when the weight of the splitter is enough to move pull on the transformer block.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This screw driver is an all in one wonder and a must for any tool box or tool belt!

Pros: The body of the screw driver is fat for good torque, and the handle is easy on the hands. The tips are hard and durable so they will last for a long time. It takes the place of at least four normal screw drivers that one would need, plus it has several specialty bits that are nice to carry around.

Cons: Its heavier than a regular screw driver it's size, but when you think about it, it's taking up the roles of 10 tools.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I purchased this product because my dishwasher used to always fill up with calcium deposits.  I was cleaning it every two months when the screens and holes in the wands would clog up.  I also had hard water stains on the faucets.

I was very skeptical about whether the product would actually work.  The science is hard to prove!

I installed one of these items on my incoming water supply.  I thought I would start there and then move it to just the hot water side if I wasn't getting the results I wanted.  Since I installed this about 6 months ago, I have never had to clean any calcium from my dishwasher wands.  Yes, I changed out my dishwasher when I installed the Eddy but I really believe I have seen a difference.  I had decided I would spend my budget on the Eddy rather than a top of the line dishwasher since they all seem to clog with the hard water in my area (200 mg/L as CaCO3 or 12 grains).  It appears to have been a good decision for me.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I have a lot of assorted bungee cords. They have come from a variety of sources: Costco specials, Harbor Freight, etc. This S. Main Hardware collection of various sized cords compares pretty well with my herd of cords in all but one respect.

Pros:
+The size assortment is good for many tasks
+ The container makes it easy to toss this set of cords in the van, ready for taking home the next _____ thing that needs to go on the luggage rack.
+++ The hooks are very nicely done. Instead of being a single thickness of wire with a rubber protector or other flimsy treatment on the end of the hook, the hooks are doubled over so that there is no sharp end that needs protection. This is great!
+ There are a lot of cords in the can.

Cons:
- I don't think these have quite the elastic range of my other cords. Not a deal killer, and I take a measurement in percent of unstretched length, but I'm gonna say these have about 20% less reach than I would have expected. I have been thinking of a way to verify this by getting a scale like those used for fishing and then pulling the end of one of these to see how far it goes with 10# of pull and doing the same with others. I'd have to have an assistant to measure the length it pulls, then do some calculations. In the meantime, my observation is as above.

Summary:

I'd still get these if they are a good price because of the hooks, which are safer for you and your gear because of the nicely finished hook tip."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"This makes a truly excellent cup of coffee or espresso - for one person. Probably you can't make a better cup given a particular roast of bean.  I just think it should be bigger.  We like strong coffee and a nice big cup of it. We make two big cups of coffee and we basically have to repeat the whole process twice. And if you have more people, well, I have other things to do with my day, just get out the old dripper I guess. If they made one twice as big I think it would be a huge improvement.

The key insight of this coffee maker is to use lots of coffee, let it soak in the water, and above all, do NOT get the water so hot. 160 or 170 degrees - you won't get the bitterness and off tastes as with hotter water. Now, using this insight, I have been able to use a drip basket instead of the Aeropress in a pinch, and get about the same quality a beverage. A lot of filter baskets taken out of drip machines have a little valve on the bottom so the coffee only drips out when a coffee pot is underneath. You can just put the filter and coffee and the not-too-hot water into this filter basket, and wait a couple minutes, then release the valve and let the coffee drain into a cup. Same quality as you get with an Aeropress, and it just proves that the not-too-hot water soak method is the key.

Frankly as they are not making a bigger model of this I think I will get a French Press. Use not-so-hot water, and make as much coffee as you need without going through the motions 2, 3, 4 times. I think the only problem with that is that a French Press does not have as fine a filter as the Aeropress and you will need to use a coarser grind of coffee or end up with a lot more sediment in your cup."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"Someone on a job-site that knocked over my crappy 10"" craftsman miter saw (was used to cut aluminum stock) gave me this Rigid as a replacement. It was practically brand new when he gave it to me. Let me just say that I wish he did not break my old Craftsman saw, because it had a straighter cut then the Rigid. I gave up on it, I have tried everything to adjust this saw right with zero luck. My Craftsman seemed to have more power too, mind you this saw has been around for 15yrs and was used pretty hard, I used it for all my junk cutting and I liked it better then the Rigid, so much I went to give it back and the guy and he told me he did not want it back, to throw it in the garbage. Sorry, for being a little harsh but this saw is junk in my own opinion for $200. It is not worth more then $100."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"We had 3 of these someone gave us for xmas, or wtvr a long time ago.  So we tossed them on the survival shelf, why not right...

So, in Ohio we had no power for 9days 2 weeks back.  On the first night we broke out what lights we had & wanting to save the good batteries / flashlights, I used these as they had really good light for such a small thing.  Using one I could walk around outside quite comfortably....

Used them for 3hrs first night, 2nd as well, then questioning how long they can run on 3 AAAs I just left them on all night, still lit in the morning & then every night through the outage & only once did I change the batteries, and those were cheapo sunbeam dollar store AAAs at that...

In the end, these lil guys that no one would think twice about, REALLY DO WORK!  So, in the end of the 9days, these were sitting 3rd down as to what we need to get more of!

These are worth 2 bucks a pop, even if you never use them!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"So I just got these tonight. I didn't necessarily like the price per bulb but hey these are the best I found on Amazon for what I need. ..  I got these bulbs to replace some other LED candle porch light I bought about six months ago. I was going to update and give a really bad review for my last bulbs as they burnt out within six months from running them over night. You do the math but I think you'll find that doesnt add up to 10,000 hours. But that was the old bulbs. These new ones are a different company and style, they are round at the tip, without the fancy angled candle tip some have. But I'm willing to give up fancy tips for a bulb that lights well. It says soft white and it matches better to my other yellowish bulb than my previous bulbs that were more bright white. Hard to explain bulb color in the dark but I'll post some pics.

As mentioned, I barely got these bulbs, but was super impressed with the color vs my old bulbs.  It looks more like a soft porch light than my old. I plan to update at a future time, gotta make sure these babies last.  First impression is buy them, good porch light color, I'll warn you if they don't last."

After about a year of use with the bulb I decided to give it a try. It is so bright that I am not using it in the dark, so it is not that bright. I have been using it in a dark room for about a year now. The light is so strong that it is blinding the most sensitive of the eye. It is bright enough to see in a dark room, but not so bright that it causes vision problems. It is very easy to adjust the brightness of the light. The light is very bright, which is why I put it in a dimmed light and put it in a dimmed light. I put it in a dimmed light and put it in a bright light.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I needed to replace my existing Malibu driveway lights, they had become broken not working and mainly a pain to upkeep. When I received the Moonrays I thought there were parts missing from the box because of the way other lights had to be connected. After reading the instructions and seeing the parts and how they connect, I thought it was pure genius, so easy to connect the light fixture to the wire compared to the messy and bulky way the other brand did. I did notice the second one I connected didn't get pierced correctly so I skimmed a little of the insulation off the wire just where it should touch the piercing pins after that connecting them was a breeze and a pleasure. I figured some college educated engineer figured this new connection design would use more wire and thus the company could make more money. I like the way you can use them on a deck, patio or stake them in the ground. Any idiot that would leave the transformer on while connecting any electrical product should have his head examined. I needed more wire to span my driveway and 14/2 from Amazon works fine and is twenty cents per foot cheaper then HD & L's. Moonrays 11604 Cable Connectors for Low Voltage Landscape Lighting are the best I've ever used for splicing additional wire to the included system. They allow no cutting and stripping of wire ends and each one has a slot for 18g, 16g. and 14gauge wire so joining wire of different gauges was a very easy task. I just installed the system today so I don't have any history with the transformer, but I'm not thrilled about having the lights stay on all night and morning. I usually use timed transformers and shut the lights off at 1AM. I'll more than likely change them out after a week or so. No need to fill FPL's coffers any more than I have to. Oh and I know the price of the whole 10 light system is the best anywhere at Amazon."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This thing is legit.  It's like the extinguishers you used to see in schools.  I think few government buildings keep them around anymore, having gone to dry chemical extinguishers as codes become more and more restrictive.  I do have typical ABC extinguishers in my garage and kitchen, but I bought this to have upstairs to fight my way to my kids' rooms in that fire that wakes you up in the middle of the night--you know, then one where  you hear the smoke detector going off and open your bedroom door to find your hallway walls and carpet completely involved.  I have no doubt this will work great for that.  I don't plan on having to extinguish any grease or chemical fires in the upstairs portion of my home.  Note that it requires a 100 psi compressor to charge (or a really good manual pump).  I opted to use my little compressor which coincidentally kicks off at 100 psi.  When re-attempting to get that last few psi in there, it did spit a little water back into the air hose, which is not ideal.  I recommend either using a sturdy hand pump or a compressor which is regulated to something well above 100 psi.
In an age where everything is made in China, and expected to be tossed out after a year, it's refreshing to find a quality American-made product which should last a lifetime.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"These are the standard tool for brake hose fittings. If you're just bleeding brakes, you can often use a box end wrench on the bleeder before attaching the hose. But if you're replacing brake lines, do yourself a favor and get a set of flare nut wrenches. This set is a good compromise between the cheap wrenches that don't fit very well and the professional-grade stuff that costs two or three times as much. I won't use these very often -- but tools that help me get the job done quickly (and without any bad language or skinned knuckles) are well worth it."

I have been using it for about a month and it seems to be working great. I am now buying another bulb for $3. 50. I would have to order another bulb if I had a problem with it.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Due to the quirks of the marketplace, this was available at a much lower price than the 6"" and 8"" wrenches in the same series. The one I received was remarkable in that the jaws were very, very close to parallel.  Most wrenches of this type, whether foreign or domestic, tend to have jaws that are closer together at the opening tip than deep towards the throat, thus requiring the user to lift up the wrench axially after each turn for repositioning, rather than pulling the wrench radially away from the nut.  If there is no room for this, then the jaws need to be loosened to remove the wrench, and retightened in the new position.  Parallel jaws, or jaws that are wider at the mouth than throat, saves the extra steps.  The post that holds the worm gear adjuster was only lightly staked, and unscrews to allow maintenance.  Due to manufacturing tolerances, however, there is no assurance that yours won't be impossible to unscrew, or that the jaws will be parallel."

But as some others have noted, the plastic cover is fragile. Drop it once, or even bump it hard, and it will crack. Attempts to glue mine back together have not been very successful. One source for a replacement dome charges $23; the current price of a whole new unit is $29.

For being cheap in the design and unreasonable about the replacement part cost, they get kicked down from 5 stars to 3.

Adequate to the task if you are gentle with it. I wouldn't recommend it for a house full of children, though.

He will be putting it up in the kitchen to use for all the remodeling. I was worried that this would be too big for the bathroom and it is. It is so small that it will not fit in the drawer.

I haven't tested the water, so I'm basing my assumption of effective filtering on faith.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I collect knives and tried this low priced traditional 'toothpick' from Buck.
Like a number of Bucks knives now, this is made in China, so I'll quickly hit a few potential quality control hot spots:

The jigged bone handle scales: mounted to the frame of the knife with no visible gaps or defects, no problem there. The jigging itself is deep and well defined, not REfined as on a Case knife, but it's low priced (an equivalent Case toothpick would cost you at least 5 times as much.) The bone material seems OK.

The blade: Evenly ground on both sides, came paper-shearing sharp (just shy of hair-shaving.) No defects. Bucks prolific 420HC steel- perfectly decent steel, Buck has a particularly good heat treat in testing. I own the Buck 119 special large fixed blade which uses the same steel.

The bolsters: Nice and glossy, the pins are buffed to near invisibility.

Blade pivot point: The blade snaps open firmly, no play side to side or up and down. It is of course a slip joint blade and does not ""lock.""

Overall, 9/10 for value. A fine choice as a gift, as a light duty every day carry pocket knife, or as a budget ""gentleman's folder"" (I bought it with this latter purpose in mind- it is thin, lightweight, and looks nice.)

In future I may try some of the competing low priced 'toothpicks' from companies like Boker, Columbia River Knife and tool, and Frosts ""Steel Warrior"" series."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I've installed two of these Panasonic fans and I'm totally sold on them.  The terrible builder quality fans are all dying in my house (six of them) so I've been retrofitting these in their place after foolishly putting in a Home Depot fan that lasted about a year.  I'm a fairly accomplished do-it-yourselfer so that said, here are a couple things to note.

1) You'll be doing some drywall cutting and patching.  I realize some folks say you don't have to patch up drywall but I can't buy that.  The flange of the fan is supposed to sit below the drywall and that requires you to put the fan in from the ceiling side of the drywall (not the attic side).  That means cutting and patching.  For me that wasn't a big deal but if you can't do any drywall patching it may be a problem.

2) The vent on these fans is 4"" in diameter and typical older houses have a 3"" vent so go ahead and buy new ducting when you purchase a fan.

3) The fan instructions tell you to use aluminum flex duct or rigid ducting but I found the plastic collapsible ducting works just fine (my ducts run less than 10' each).

4) If you use a mechanical timer on the fans (like the dial wind up Intermatic timers) the ticking of the timer may be too loud.  Yep, the fan is that quiet.  The loud ticking may bother you and force a switch to an electronic timer.

These fans are expensive.  However, compared to my old fans that sound like a blender full of rocks these Panasonic fans are almost undetectable when they run.  If I were building a house I'd insist on these fans.  They are absolutely worth the money."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Just excellent! This socket removed a water heater element from a 20+ year old water heater with zero maintenance. I broke a home depot water heater element extraction tool, and with this one and a 24"" breaker bar, the element came out with no problems at all. With that I discovered that my water heater is a decade past replacement but that's another story. I wasn't really sure of what I was going to receive so I'm going to try to explain it a little more for future purchasers. This is a normal profesional grade socket which I really couldn't imagine anyone breaking. It matches with a 1/2"" drive wrench. What differences it is that blue piece in the image. That's a blue plastic insert which rotates freely, and whose job is to fit around the water heater element and hold it in place. This makes it alot easier to install and remove since you don't have to hold the water heater element and socket together while trying to remove it. It was an A+ idea and really makes your life easier. It also makes it easier to install the element straight and not mess up the threads.

The other thing that made me think about purchasing or not this item is that in the image, the socket seems very shallow. Let me just say that's only how it looks at first. This socket is deep enough to fully grasp just about any water heater element.

Well that's it. I couldn't really recommend it more. Theres just nothing wrong with it, and it works perfectly. Much better than the other options on ebay, and for 15$ it may not be worth it in materials but it is definitely worth it in usefulness."

After I finally attached the tubing to my floor fan with the tiny zip ties furnished, I screwed in the ""nozzles"" and secured my water hose to the inlet and turned the water on.  The nozzles were a screw-in type and were cheaply made because they leaked.  I tried every water pressure possible to try to make this work, but the nozzles either ""spit"" or dripped and soaked everything in front of the fan.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"I had an earlier version of this and thought it would be a nice addition to the tool box.

I had to replace a couple of the blades with the new blades.  The saw came with a few loose blades which were very difficult to remove and use.  The blade was not a very good quality blade and it was difficult to use the new blades.  I also had to use a screw driver to remove the blade and replace the blades with a new blade.  The blade did not work for me and I had to use a pliers to remove the blade.  The saw was very sharp and I really liked the saw.  I have not used it for a long time but it looks great in my tool box.  I would recommend this saw for anyone looking for a good quality saw.

Update:  I have now replaced the blades with the new blades.  The saw has a nice finish and I like the look of the saw.  The blade looks very solid and the blade tips are very sharp.  The saw is a bit large for my purposes but I think it is a good quality saw and I would"

It's a sturdy piece. It works really well for me as a printer stand and the shelves are perfect for printer paper and other supplies. It is significantly cheaper than other printer stands and would also be great for its intended use as a nightstand.

otherwise:
if there is movement, the light shines bright (which is what you want)
if there is no movement, the light shines dimly but noticeably. I don't think there's a way to turn it off, but I wish there was."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This is an excellent head lamp, Vitchelo has out done themselves. A little warning to any potential buyers of the Vitchelo V600 Plus. This doesn't work the same as the regular V600. The up side of this fact; this is the first headlamp flashlight with a dimming feature. I highly recommend reading, and understanding the directions for these headlamps by Vitchelo.
  Shipping was very prompt, only two days. The headlamp comes in a nifty leather pouch, another first for a headlamp. And the batteries provided are Duracell Copper Top. Not some cheap off brand batteries, often provided in new flashlights.
  In the purchase of my last Vitchelo head lamp, I wasn't sure how water, and weather proof this product achieves. I'm happy to say; the Vtchelo
V 600 exceeded my expectations in keeping out all water. My Vitchelo V600 is also very rugged. After 6 months of being strapped to my hard hat, as I work on all sorts of cranes. My V600 has taken many hard bumps; I've onIy replaced the batteries twice, and my quality head lamp keeps working and working. I'm very impressed with the Vitchelo product line. I know this same standard of quality will carry over into my Vitchelo V600 Plus.
  I've also ordered the Vitchelo flashlight lantern, and hammock strap products. Although my delivery has been delayed, I'm highly anticipating the arrival of my new products by Vitchelo.

They have been a great solution for a HOA, who has mailbox covered porches, but there is no power to run lighting at night. We installed 12 lights, 2 on each building. They seem to work well, as long as they charge during the day. When we installed them, we did have 2 lights that would not work.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"Worked great but failed to heat after a year. Visually identical to one I bought at a ""big box"" store.  One of many cheaply made brands, usually constructed in foreign nations and imported.  This particular one failed like two others we bought because they use a mechanical thermostat that uses inferior materials for the electrical contacts.  After a year or so of constant use, the contacts form pits from the welding-like spark that takes place when the contacts separate.  Eventially the contacts are destroyed and the heater core fails to warm to the proper temperature.  It may never get warm or it may get too hot.

Be forewarned: heater elements which glow red hot can ignite hair and cloth fibers that get sucked into the heater and cause fires.  Shut the fan off and clean it thorough if you smell the oder of burning hair or other burning smells."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"Flimsy construction, and warped. I bought 3 and they are all this way. However, in my cabinets with moderate weight, they are functional. Would not buy again but considering these were the cheapest available for this size, I got what I paid for."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"These motion night lights are the best.

I'm not the one that likes lights running at night, I like it dark to sleep and even a nightlight in the bathroom glowing is too much light for me.  I installed at first one of these in the bathroom and loved it so much I had to buy more packs so we could put one in the kitchen, on the basement stairs, laundry room, and additional bathroom.

The light turns on only when you need it, when your in the room.  The light is plenty bright to see what you are doing in the bathroom (not for reading though) but not too bright to wake you totally up at night.  It turns on and runs for about 45 seconds unless additional motion is detected.

I find myself leaving the lights off when I go into the basement as the motion nightlight is plenty bright enough for me to sagely climb the stairs or walk in the basement without fear of tripping over the pet.

I had some relatives over and one of them commented on the nightlight so much that I ended up giving her one for her own home.  She afterwards commented how much she loved having it.  Simple devices make life so much easier...

PROS:
- Low Voltage LED
- Uses very little power
- Will illuminate a 10x8 bathroom no problem (not a reading brightness though)
- Only on when you want it on
- Bright enough to see what you are doing without waking you up too badly at night
- You'd better buy the multi-pack or you'll be buying again
- Runs for about 45 seconds unless more motion detected
- Have been using now for about 2 years without a failure

CONS:
- Wish I had found these a long time ago (I hated the 7watt nightlights)
- Cat runs by it to see in her litter box (I though they could see well in the dark)"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Over a year ago, I bought a B&D 20V Max drill/driver, which has become indispensable. The 20V battery pack seems to last ""forever.""  Based on this experience, I set about replacing my old Sears 19.8V tool set with Black & Decker 20V Max tools. (The Sears batteries were no longer capable of retaining a charge long enough to be useful.)  The BDCCS20B circular saw is a new addition to the 20V Max family.  It serves me well for trimming shelves and various projects around the house.  And unlike the old circular saw, I don't have to stop every half hour to replace the battery pack. My new 20V Max tool set also includes the recip saw (also reviewed) and the edger/trimmer.  I will continue to rely on Black & Decker for more 20V Max tools!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"I moved into a new house that had been built about a year before.  For the past 17 months I have been changing batteries very often in my three CO detectors.  I finally started putting dates on the batteries and found that they only last 2 months (1 month in a cold basement).  I'm guessing I spent about $70 in batteries.  The batteries are only there to kick in when the AC power fails, which it rarely does and never for very long.  However, my tests indicate that the batteries are being drained while the AC power is properly working.

I contacted the company for warranty replacements and was told I would have to pay $20 for shipping & HANDLING to get my ""FREE"" warranty replacements.  I made a big stink and got them to send them at their expense.  Only time will tell if the replacements work.  Till then I can work on the problem of random beeps from my BRK smoke detectors.

Update: I could not take the random beeping any more.  I finally threw out (and replaced) all the BRK detectors (smoke & CO2) in the house and the random beeping finally stopped.  I will never buy another BRK product as long as I live."

The other light I have, I'm very happy with, is the LED bulb.  The bulb is bright, and the cover is not too big.  It's not too thick, but it's not too small.

It's easy to pull out.  I recommend wrapping the box with 2"" packing tape to make it a little more durable and water resistant, since it's a cardboard box.  I used it for wiring low powered LED lighting for cars and lawnmowers, which need a flexible copper wire and a variety of colors.  It can handle up to 70 watts at 12 volt DC, which now includes a lot of inexpensive and unbreakable LED spot lights and work lights.  in my case, it's license plate lights and tiny work lights for dark recesses of my lawn mower."

If you are thinking about buying one of these you should definitely buy the Makita DeWalt 11-Inch 24-Inch 24-Inch Makita DeWalt, with the 9-Inch Makita DeWalt, and the 12-Inch Makita DeWalt, because the DeWalt is the best. I'm glad I did. I like the design of this blade. I have to get the blade to come out of the box, but I don't want to be stuck with a box full of knives. This blade is the best I have used. I would recommend this blade to anyone. I really like these. They are very bright. I use them to light up a room and they are very good. I have been using them for several months now and I am very happy with them. I have used the adjustable dimmer switches in the kitchen to dim the lights in the kitchen. I have had this for about a year now and am very happy with it. The dimmer switch is very dim and I have not had any problems with it. It does not come with a timer, so if you have a timer in your kitchen, you can set it to turn off the lights but you can not turn off the dimmer switch."

A couple from the 50s have skim coat covered dry wall  which no stud finder I tried would reliably find a stud on  it was little better than a flip of a coin, even the most expensive fancy-pants electronic versions out there.  Regular dry wall, dandy  you're getting solid lights every time.  Through tile, mud-bed installs, skim coat over  dry wall: not a chance.  This bad boy works.  For realz bro.  I used it to install two bathroom fans this last weekend and it was perfect.  With the skim coat its not strong enough to stick to a wall or ceiling but the stick stands up and gives you a high-five when it crosses a nail or screw.  Yes, it can take a minute of systematic swiping to find the first one and then move up and down to verify (in the ceiling it helps to know which way the joist travel).  Super happy with this.

Nest/Google survey ""encouraged"" me to come here and do it even though my protects have only been installed for about 2 days. I normally would just ignore their desires and do this on my own time but it's annoying enough to share with you. First, nothing ever gets a 5 star review from me without reason. I start at the middle of the road (3 stars in this case) and find reasons to add or subtract from there. So, -1 for annoying marketing department causing me to review this but I kind of understand why... The previous gen 1 protects were a flop from what I've researched. Add 1 point for others reviews saying that these things actually do what they say they are going to do without false alarms. That leaves us at 3/5. Add 1 point for combining multiple smoke and co detection methods. Add another for creating a ""mesh"" network of interconnected detectors that can calmly and efficiently inform me of situations. Subtract a giant 1 point (hard time limiting this to only 1 star) for NOT integrating with other wired detectors. The orange/red wire exists for a reason and that's to kick off alerts in other areas!!

No More stopping to sharpen knives, no more chopping boards at a height too high for your comfort, no more cuts to your hands and fingers.  Plus, simple to clean and sanitize.  Chopped pieces are relatively uniform in size, and can be chopped into large or smaller squares.  Here's a tip: The least-fatiguing way to use this is to place the machine on a table of lower height--for me, that is 26"".  From this lower height, I can use my upper body weight, just like tall people do, to aid the chopping motion.  I can do 10lbs carrots in about 15mins.  The only feature missing is where to find replacement chopping screens.  Anyway, scoop this chopper up, you'll be very glad you did."

Basically, you set the level on any surface close to level, then make a mark on the surface at the end of the level and take a reading. Next rotate the level and place the other end of the level at the mark and take another reading. You should get the same reading both ways. I had to return."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I am loving this expresso maker.  It is a good value and my only complaint is the extra coffee cup.  The plastic part is very small, and the inside is very large.  The only complaint is that the lid is very small.  This is a great product for the price.  I have used the most expensive non-perfume coffee makers in the past.  I would buy this again.  I am very happy with this product.This is a great buy for the price. I have used it a few times and it is well made. It's a little small but it's definitely worth it.I love the way it heats up.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it's not as quiet as a regular fan.  I was worried it would be loud but it's quiet enough for me.  I'm not sure if it would work as well as the fan I've used before.  But I'm happy with this purchase and will definitely buy another one.I'm always looking for a lightweight rug to make my living room look great. This is exactly what I was looking for.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"Good value - but all of the locks are opposite.  So when they are in the ""unlocked"" position, they are vertical.  Most locks are turned vertically to be locked - not these.  It's confusing and a little annoying but they seem to be ok.  The door jam plates didn't line/up or work on 1/2 of our order of 10, so we just used the old ones for now.  One set that we used ended up failing after a month (locking mechanism didn't open/shut all the way and it became a nuisance - had to just uninstall it and now have to be replaced.  We bought them seeing all the other reviews b/c we wanted to update our downstairs door knobs, but the price reflects the quality.  A little on the cheap side.  Was it worth it? I guess (shrug)."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"The day after I ordered this my husband came home with a DC40 Animal which he got at a warehouse store for way less.  Since it was a gift and included an upholstery brush I kept it and returned the one I ordered which, as an aside, was super easy.

I love the Dyson.  While it's kind of heavy and the ball thing is awkward the cleaning power is phenomenal. Don't have carpeting but the area rugs look almost new.
Am kind of partial to bagless vacs...gives me an instant return on my efforts by seeing what I've actually picked up and this canister is easy to empty.

The cord is plenty long as is the hose, great for my high ceilinged rooms.

The time to assemble the machine was approx 10 minutes, so easy I wondered if I had done it right.  Have read complaints about the instruction manual but I found it as adequate as I needed it to be.

Another thing which convinced me that the Dyson cleans better than any machine I've owned is that after a weekly vac I can use my Roomba and the little robot doesn't constantly bog down and need cleaning.  It can complete an entire cleaning cycle without begging for help.  In a household with 2 dogs and a cat that is something.

Yeah, I love my Dyson and so does the iRobot. We're both happy now."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I was thinkinf about gettinf my carpet cleaned professionally until I caught this on sale. I figured, why not. I was disgusted at hiw filthy my carpet really was. I read in another review that it'll be best to first go over the carpet in the rinse mode to first loosen the dirt before switching over to the wash cycle. I probably changed rhe water 5 times before getting to wash bc this was pulling up so much gunk even though my carpet didn't even look bad! I found the accessories a pain at forst in regards to having to pull the water tubing part of the hose back out after I was finished. However, other than that, I am happy. This hoover does wonders and I love it. Will probably go back over my carpet weekly until the water tank comes out completely clear. Do small sections at a time. I was at it for hours in amazement."

I had a similar model at Home Depot that was a bit too strong and was difficult to unlock. It was a little more difficult to unlock if you were using the doorbell with the doorbell mounted on the wall. I did not have the option to install the lock in the wall. It took about 15 minutes to install the lock, but it took about 30 seconds to open it.

The lock is very sturdy, and the handle is very well built.

Overall, it's a good lock. It's a good lock. I'm not a big fan of the other brand's locking mechanisms. I've had mine for about a year and I'll likely be replacing them all with this one"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I literally use this blender every day. It has replaced most all of my kitchen appliances!

We have no problems with chunky smoothies on the 1st try. We put carrot chunks, frozen spinach, giant chunks of frozen raspberries and they liquefy no problem. My toddler drinks her smoothies thru a sippy cup! I love that I can add fruits and veggies and even avocado for extra nutrition and they slurp it right up!

It chops nuts and veggies for easy cooking prep.

I make batter and dough in it effortlessly several times a week. We eat Paleo/gluten free, so I make most all muffins, cookies, cakes & breads from scratch. We even make homemade Lara bars in seconds!

The preprogrammed buttons apply to most everything you would want to do.

A Spatula can scrape out under the blades and get out every last bit (unlike Vitamix)

It fits under my kitchen cabinet (unlike Vitamix)

The blades are not sharp so no worry about you or your kids getting cut and they never dull (unlike Vitamix)

The recipe book is great a great guide for most anything you may want to do with this awesome blender!

8 year warranty and from what the rep (at Costco) said it's an easy process if needed

The best part may be the clean up. A cup or 2 of water and a few drops and let it rip. The cup is all one piece, so you don't have to take it apart to wash and then put it all back together again.

One thing to know in deciding between the 4-side and wild side cup, the wildside is bigger so makes more, but requires a bit more volume to work correctly, so if you want to make smaller smoothies or batches of batters you may prefer the 4 side cup."

My wife loves it now where as originally she was not impressed now she loves it. I am buying another for my self. I tried it also and found surprisingly good. You must give this a little time to shape to your neck with out becoming so soft as to give little to no support.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,I was very disappointed in this product.  I thought it was very cheaply made.  It had plastic and not glass for the front and it was all scratched up.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I have other utensils in aqua sky that are made by KitchenAid. I have found all of them to be of very good quality. This one is longer than I expected but I believe I will be able to utilize it in my kitchen. Due to the thickness of the spatula Edge I don't think it would be very good for turning fried eggs but many other items could be turned with ease. For the price tag of $5.25 it is an exceptional value.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"I purchased this product (DealYard) on 12/26/2013, and received it on 1/2/2014. Was packed well, and arrived in good condition. I used it for the first time on 1/7/2014 and it performed very well, I vacuumed a few bags and tried out the containers and they sealed very well. My next attempt to use was on 1/8/2014 on a couple of the Gal. bags, after a couple of seconds of vacuuming the machine started making a load clicking sound and shut off as though it was done. The problem was it had not removed all the air, and when I repeated the process the same thing happened. Fearing if I continued to try I would irreparably harm the machine I stopped and called the number on the warranty / registration card. I was told that they have not sold this product for over 3 years, and I would have to take it up with how sold it to me. That would be fine if they did not require that the buyer had to pay to have it shipped back to them, half the cost of the product in the first place. WARNING...

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,There is a reason it is so inexpensive. It emits a loud buzz when a USB device is plugged into it. And it is so wide that it would be dangerous to install in a metal box or in any box with another device. Spend a few more bucks on a better product.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I had ordered these to store my sewing patterns in, but realized too late that the inner dimensions are much smaller than the outer dimensions as pointed out in another review here, so my patterns wouldn't fit at all. Instead I ended up using them to store small scraps of cotton fabrics separated by color family, with all six drawers stacked one on top of the next.

Its actually a lot more stable than I would have thought it would be, and the drawers do hole quite a bit of fabrics- you could easily put two dozen fat quarters in each one with room left over. So, not good for storing patterns, but good for other things and pretty stable.

I was initially going to refuse the package and return them, but glad I decided to keep them after all.

The unit I found to store my sewing patterns in isn't offered here on Amazon, but its a 5 drawer Sterilite unit that stands about 40"" high. I got mine at Big Lots. It even holds my Vogue patterns which come in larger envelopes."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"I ordered 2 of these for my kids. The bands are challenging to stretch over the mattress far enough so that when you pull the opposite side to do that band the other end pulls up from the opposite side- not all the way off, but it still is a back and forth. Today after 2 months of use one of the elastic corner bands came apart from the mattress pad. It already broke and I've only taken it off the bed 3 times. A total waste of money. Get the kind that is like a sheet and goes all the way down. I was hoping I could return these and get my money back but my return window closed 2 weeks ago. One of them has never even been out of the package."

I would buy another one for the price and they will be perfect.This is a great product for the price. It works well, but I wish it was better. I put it in a refrigerator and it's working fine.I used this for a couple of months and it still works just fine. I have been using it to keep ice cold for a few months now and I like it. It has a good grip on the spoon, doesn't move around a lot and keeps the ice cold longer. It does not have the rust spots I've had with the pan. I bought a couple of other pans that have rust spots but this one is doing the job.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I have not received any compensation for my unbiased review.  I would not have purchased this product if it were not for the reviews I received.  I hope this helps others.This is a good quality and works well. It comes with a nice cover and a handy timer. The knob is nice and easy to use.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"These came with not directions, I looked on their website and could not find any either. Just a link to fill out my name and download a PDF which turned out to be a brochure with zero install instructions. Now you really don't need a ton of instructions if you know in general what you are doing. But seriously, no instructions on their website? What is this 1998?
As far as the product it looks good when you are done, but there are some issues.
-The returns fit inside the rails and they recommend using silicone to glue them in place. They sit pretty far out from the wall which sort of defeats the purpose. ( they are to keep from people catching clothing or other things over the railing and that causing a fall) the returns stood out I would say 3/4 of an inch. (I should have measured but did not)
-They are hard to get to fit nice and tight against the pipe. This goes about 2x for the knuckle joint if you use that I used wide masking tape to hold them in place.
- The email I received in response to my request for install specs or instructions was a zip file that contained a virus according to Yahoo mail. I tried to download another copy they sent to my phone and I was warned that it wanted to ""install an application from an unknown source"" then It wanted some admin privileges?? I have a super ordinary phone so it was not me What the hell is wrong with a PDF or even a word or text file like 99.97% of people use?"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I was looking for something that would be lightweight and comfortable for a travel mug, but I just wanted a cup that wouldn't get hot.  The basic design of this mug is pretty straight forward, and it's a good size for a standard mug.  The handle is very comfortable, and it's easy to clean.  I'm very happy with it.  It has a very nice shape, and the handle seems to hold up quite well."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,have not used it yet but had the item before and it does good.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"This could have been great. Unfortunately the most important feature is useless. The belt clip seems tight and springy, but put in your belt and it slips off with almost no effort. Someone suggested taping it, which is a poor (and ugly) fix. My solution was to drill through the metal clip and rivet it. Just insert a wooden block, drill through the clip, remove the block, insert a rivet from the inside, replace the block, add the cap and hammer it home. It doesn't interfere with the tool at all.

But, speaking of the tool - While this has become my fave for every day use, the CS4 has tools on the outside and they snag the case when you try to insert the tool. I have a Blast, which I use for work, and a Rebar, which lives in my wife's car. Both tools have their bladess mounted INSIDE the handles.

This is a 5 star item now that I've ""fixed"" it, but as it was, because it's so very easy to lose, 3 stars."

I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. I would highly recommend this product. I purchased this for my husband and it's great! I will be buying another one soon!I love this so much I bought one for myself. I love the fact that it is so easy to clean and so easy to store. I've used it for a few weeks now and it still works great!  I'm super happy with it. I have used this for a couple of months now and it is working just fine. It does a good job of keeping my coffee hot. I've had no problems with the drip mechanism, the coffee is not hot as I'd expected. It's not really a bad product, I was just disappointed in the way it was shipped. I bought a couple of small boxes of the coffee maker and was very pleased with the results. I would highly recommend this product."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I'm an idiot and didn't know what I was getting. I saw this one in the local store. It's not the best but it's good and the price is right. I used it to make a little bread in the oven. It worked well.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Installed it myself. It works great. I really like it when I can go to my phone or computer and change the temperature when I am away from the house. It also sends me texts or e-mails when the temperature goes above or below a programed temp that I selected.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is the best pan I've ever used.  I also own a Wolf Gourmet pan, which is good, but this Viking pan is even better!  It conducts heat so well that I cooked chicken breasts last night on my gas burner stove on the low to low-medium heat setting.  A 1.5 tablespoon pad of butter melted so quickly yet didn't burn, which made cooking so unbelievably easy.  I also love how deep the pan is, reducing (eliminating) grease splatter.  The three chicken breasts were very large but had plenty of room in this pan to cook completely evenly despite the fact that the flames underneath did not extend more than a couple inches out from the center of the pan.  Even my children noticed a difference in the quality of the meat saying how juicy and tasty the chicken was compared to how it's usually cooked, especially when the breasts are so thick.

Note, the instructions that come with the pan tell you to condition the pan with oil before first use and then every few months after.  I did condition the pan per the instructions and I'm glad I followed that tip ahead of time."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"As part of my significant renovation throughout a recently-purchase house, I bought this faucet for my bar sink just two weeks ago.  This faucet was extremely easy to install.  Since I did not have to remove the old faucet (there was no faucet at this sink when I bought the house), it took me all but 10 minutes to have this up and running.  Just put the whole faucet through the sink hole.  Screw in the mounting plate from the below.  Hook up the water supply hoses and you are set.  Please note that I am a fairly typical DIYer not expert, so I think most anybody would be able to install this faucet.

My experience with Amazon has been great.  The box arrived quickly.  Although it is advertised as oil-rubbed bronze, the color is fairly light not as dark as some of the other bronze faucets that I have.  In fact, the picture on Amazon is a lot darker than the actual faucet.  There were also no hoses included with the faucet, so you will need to buy them separately.

Overall, it's a good buy, but only time will tell how it will hold up."

I have two of these fence-boards and also a miter slot board.  Love 'em.  The 5/16"" t-bolts that these come with this work well in the fence slots I made using a slot-cutting bit from Lee-Valley/Veritas.  I should mention that they do not fit in the slots on my Ridgid table saw fence, which uses 1/4"" slots.  If I want to use these on my table say, I will need some 1/4"" bolts.  No big deal.  Highly recommended."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,CG,"Overall I like it, but it has the design flaw. I will admit that it's a bit annoying. If you want to get a solid feel for the feel of the blade, it's worth it.

This nifty rack keeps bottles angled upward just enough to avoid possible leaks, and of course the bottles don't clank around. You can even bend the lower part of the rack down just enough to increase the tilt of the bottles if you wish. And of course, this thing is a big space saver. Perfect."

One bag contains screws with plastic anchors for drywall installation, the other set comes with short, thick screws for wood installation.  First 2 screws went in with ease, but the third screw busted only 3/4 of the way in..the head broke right off!  I know I didn't ""over-tighten"" because the screw wasn't even in all the way!

My basement drain was backing water up into my basement. , it was about 8"" high by the drain and it was just getting higher and higher - luckily my basement is sloped and not much damage was done.  Immediately I pulled this pump out and set it up to use it my first time.  Attached both hoses that I got for it, filled the top with water and put the strainer on the hose that I put into the water.  Immediately it started pumping water at a decent rate outside.  This kept the water level down (in fact, it drained all of it in about 1.5 hours) until I could get to Home Depot the next morning to rent a power snake and clear the clog.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Its a good filter, easy to install, made of lightweight plastic (a good thing because it will not make the shower pipe droop down like the old heavy ones did) and it completely eliminates all the smell of chlorine and everyone stopped complaining of dry itchy skin after I installed it.

The only tip I should pass along is that the you install a new one, do instal the hose and point the hose at the drain, as close as you can get to the drain) then slowly turn up the water. The first few seconds that the water is running it will throw out some carbon from this filter. The carbon is, of course, completely harmless but its particles are so small that will get trapped in the texture of your shower floor and leave a black mark. It eventually goes away but it might be noticeable to some people.

The other tip I can offer is that this is an effective filter but it clogs up easily. There are only two of us that use the one in the master bath and it only lasts 4 months (once it lasted 5 months, I got al excited but the next one only lasted 5 months again). I do wish that it lasted longer because I have having to recycle the perfect shell, but that is a small wish for future versions.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I don't love these, but they are hanging in my house. I didn't look closely at the dimensions of this item, so that's my fault for somehow imagining something larger. This was an impulse buy, and the price was right. I also didn't realize that it wasn't 3 boards attached for each plaque - it's a solid board that has lines painted on them. They look nice on the wall though."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,FINALLY. we ha finally found a better way to cook food. This is my go to starter pot. I have had it for a few months and have used it twice a day. It's a little smaller than I thought it would be but it cooks evenly and it's not the best pan.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,I ordered these bags and was sent some cheap Version and knock off. I am terribly disappointed in what they sent me. But of course at this price point it's not worth my time to it send back.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Very useful clamps. It's good to have a couple of long reach clamps
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"These are serving their purpose of keeping down from escaping, but the ones I got from the Company Store are much softer and nicer."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,I ordered this pie pan to make smaller pies for just one or two people because I felt the six inch was a little too small. I like the size it works well with refrigerated pie crust. When using canned filling I like to drain off some of the liquid before filling so the pie has more fruit and the filling fits well in the pan. I have washed mine by hand only and dried immediately and had no rust issues yet.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"This is a great rug, it feels great and is very comfortable. I have a large one and a small one. The rug is solid and is well made. It is very soft and comfortable. I would highly recommend this rug.I use this as a ""pumpkin grinder"""
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,I use this to lift up a foldable trailer.  The rope is pretty rough and gloves are necessary.  It provides enough mechanical advantage to lift the tongue of the trailer up to vertical.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"It was nice to be able to order just spoons for my set, great quality."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"I got this to match my old Toto tools. I also love that it's been one of the best purchases I've made,"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"This serves the purpose that it was designed to do, and was delivered promptly. It is as described. However, one complaint I have is that the shelves are not re-inforced with any type of material (like cardboard), so they sag in the middle. Imagine thin fabric shelves rather than structured ones. Other than that, it does what it is supposed to."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"I've been using these as a night light for about a month now.  They work great and are a great value.  I am using them in the morning, when I am going to go to bed in the morning.  They are also useful as night lights for people who have a lot of sleep.

I did get a free item for review.  Thank you.

Update:  Now I have a few more.  I have a pair of these on my phone that I use for all the time.  I love these and it works great!  I'm glad I bought them.I have used these for a couple of months now.  They do work well for my purposes.  The only issue is that I can't get them to work at all.  I can't even get them to turn on and off.  I can't figure out why.  I'm hoping that I will eventually get a replacement for these.  I am going to try them on at least one of the other 2 sets of lights.  I would recommend this product to anyone.

One thing to note:  these have a very slight yellow tint on the back of the head which is typical for the white light bulbs. "
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I purchased this bed and have slept on it for the past week. I believe in trying things out to make sure my guests won't suffer from backaches, etc.

The Aerobed provides a comfortable night's rest. I have slept like a baby after trying this air mattress out. I would highly recommend this product to anyone."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Keeps coffee hot at a time. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the coffee in the container. I wish I'd bought the plastic one first. I used to go through a couple of cups of water a day and it would be fine. I would have loved to have a smaller one. I did get a glass one and it is a little heavier than I expected. It does hold a decent amount of water. It's easy to clean and not too heavy for me to get into a coffee cup. I really like that it has a coffee maker.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Mild scent and burned for a couple of hours.  I will keep my roses in the house
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,i saw these used on a recent cruise.  they were a must have.  will try them out at the pool on windy days.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,My hot cocoa is finally perfect! This product is fabulous
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Excellent wire mesh strainer on the back and the cord is included in the package. I have one in my bathroom and the other in a closet. The cord is not flexible at all and does not stay in
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I have had this Presto for a couple of months and I really love it. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The Presto is a great little vacuum that takes up little space. It is a little bit noisy but it is worth it. The reviews said it

I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.  I would buy it again.Very good value.Great for the price.  I have used it for 3 months and have never had to remove the ballast.  I have had to use a different brand to get it to stick.  I am very pleased with this product.  I have used it for
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"My wife got me this and it was the best purchase I made. It's been one of the best purchases I've made, and I am very happy with the purchase. I have used this bulb in the past. I am very pleased. This bulb is excellent. The light is bright and the color is warm and warm. I can't wait to use it in my kitchen."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I set these up in bedroom and they are a  light color but opaque so they still provide darkening quite.  I have not washed them yet so that remains to be seen.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"much smaller than expected but thats not a complaint.
I actually got this to use as a dome light on my Jeep Wrangler TJ. I have it hooked to the little bracket thats above the rear view mirror and fits perfectly.
the light angles up and down so the fact that I can point the light in the needed direction is a nice plus and better than a stock dome light.

for the hat this is perfect. its so tiny and lightweight it will work great for its intended purpose. I tried it on my hat and lights up well enough to see where you are going. not going to light up the whole yard but perfect for normal wallking and even for reading a book etc.

batteries seem to last forever for my occasional use as a dome light."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I love these!!! I use them all the time. They are prefect for my needs.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,every bit as good as the name brand; do not hesitate to get these!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"This is the same bowl that I had bought at a local grocery store for a couple of years. It's not the best quality, but it is the best I've ever used. The only thing I wish it were a"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Great price for this combination.  It comes with a hard plastic shield along with the mesh but I found I like the mesh better because it allows air flow and keeps my face from getting too hot.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I love bamboo for cutting on because it's much easier on my knives than regular wood and certainly easier on them than my stainless steel counters. I also love bamboo because it's lighter than regular woods.

This set has 3 boards in convenient sizes. The smallest has a 6"" x 6 1/2"" cutting area (that doesn't include the cut out handle area) and is perfect for cutting lemons, limes, etc. The medium board has an 8 1/4"" x 9 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle) and the largest board has a 9 1/2"" x 11 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle area.) All three boards are about 3/8"" thick.

The boards are nicely finished and only require occasional seasoning with food grade mineral oil to keep them from drying out. They look beautiful even left out on the counter but can be easily hung out of the way using the handle cut out.

FYI: studies have proven that wooden boards are much more sanitary than those made of synthetic materials. The wood itself has antimicrobial properties. You can wash these boards in warm, soapy water and dry them - although they should not be put in a dishwasher or in the microwave.

The current price of ~$11 is excellent for the quality of these boards. They aren't like the thick, heavy bamboo cutting blocks that cost $100+, but with appropriate care they should last a number of years.

NOTE: I received a free or discounted sample for review but a positive review was not asked for, promised or implied."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,My kid loves it. It looks great and the materials are good.  I just wish the one
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"The first thing you notice is how lightweight these are -- does not feel like glass, feels more like plastic. They come in a white unmarked box with no branding, no care instructions, and no indication whether they are microwave safe. But apart from that they seem ok."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,This is the Spanner needed for my garage door opener. I also needed this for the door opener

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"10 Stars, I would highly recommend this item. We love this blanket."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,Other reviews stated problems with theses bulbs. I installed two of them one lasted about 12 hours so who knows on the others. I will not buy anymore and would not suggest them to others.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,We bought this to get the hard top off our jeep and to store it when not in use. It has worked great.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,it is a gfci outlet. I have an AC outlet too.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,The inflatable salad bar served it's purpose very well. I would have helped if we had an air pump with us.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Really easy installation, but design is a little tricky to put together.  There is a hinge that is a little too short to fit, but that is okay.  It is very sturdy and it is well made.  The carpet is very soft and it is very firm.  The machine works well.  I love the fact that I can use the auto-wash feature.  I have had this machine for over a year and am very pleased with it.This is a great product"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I love Honey Do products!  I love this over the door shoe holder. I have four of them. Perfect way to organize shoes and keep them off the floor of your closet. I can't live without them
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"these are very nice - nice colors and the finish is good. These are very strong and sturdy. I had to replace a couple of the plastic ones, so it is not that big of a deal. I am a bit disappointed."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I have been using the small Lasko heater for a couple of years now, and finally decided to upgrade to this bigger unit.  I like the small ones, but there are two problems - they offer very focused (almost painful) heat if you are too close, but are too small to sit farther away from them and still feel warm, and they don't heat up a large space.

This version is GREAT.  It's big enough that you don't have to be right next to it to get warm, it heats up my big room relatively quickly, and I *love* that it shuts itself off when it hits a certain temperature (my other Lasko does not).  This was well worth the money.  My other Lasko has lasted three years and is still going strong (I use it at work), so I expect this one will last for years, as well.  A great purchase."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,cute - my granddaughter is 3 & has it in her play kitchen set

I have a typical 16' garage door and figured I could just cut 4' off in length.  Well unfortunately, this is a very wide seal and just bunched up at the bottom.  It was unuseable.  They did take a return and I swapped it out for one that was 2 1/2"" wide and 18' long.  This product was well made for the price.  just the wrong one for my application"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Love the way the top holds the suction cups. I also love that the suction cups are
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,i had a kershaw that was stolen years ago--unfortunately i got a gerber paragraph which i really liked since it was so thin but geez it would be dull after any use.... so i decided to get another kershaw and this leek is about the thinnest you're gonna find.  sharp enough to shave and holds its edge.  i recommend keeping any water away from it --may be a coincidence but i rinsed it and soon developed the famous faint click/tick when closing.  but i love the assist and mostly open it with my index finger.  i carry a blade every day no matter what.  the slim design won't bulge or snag and you'll forget you have it on your pocket.  buy this for yourself or a gift--you won't be disappointed --worth every penny
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"For me, this pillow wasn't a good fit!  It is an extremely heavy, very dense pillow!  Initially it seemed comfortable enough, but quickly lost its shape!  I have to continually flip it and reshape it.  I was expecting soft memory foam, but it is very firm.  Fabric is nice and it seems very well constructed.  It just isn't the right pillow for me."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,not sure - didn't have any AAA batteries when power went out.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Great pillow protector.  Well made and soft with no sound.  Have purchased these twice now and would purchase again!

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Keeps weld splatters off my welding nozzle tip which is what I bought it for.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,Nice modern look for the price. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"I had a drippy Hansgrohe (Cordless) bulb that came on my incandescent bulbs. I had a very dimmable, warm white light that was not so bright. This bulb had a bulb that was in the same room as the bulb. This bulb was far brighter"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"My sons room is done in an alligator theme, and even though this is a dinosaur, it fits right in! I was so excited when I saw this, it's just so charming and fun for kids.

There are a few different options of these clocks, like a dog, cat and rocket ship (my second favorite!) He comes with the standards like a digital clock and an easily programmable alarm (though the noise it makes is a faint beep, so I wouldn't recommend on relying on it to wake up for work haha). Of course the best features are some unique add-ons. Like the ability to project not only the time on the ceiling, but also 1 of 4 different dinosaur pictures. You do have the options to either have both, just one or neither, which is pretty awesome to me. He plugs into the wall with a pretty generous cord length.

I am super impressed with this alarm, it's really adorable, feels well made and has some really great features. I love his look, I love the dinosaur pictures, I've included some photos below. There is a simple turning knob on the back to switch between the photos. The numbers that are projected are a bright red, so easily seen but don't produce much extra light leaving things dark. Or you can turn on the picture and it acts as a dim night light! Not enough good things to say, I have zero complaints. My son is only 3 but I hope this lasts into his teens cause its really great."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I positively love this ottoman...I purchased this to store my extra blankets and pillow...it was delivered on time and I only had to screw in the little legs...the top has hinges so it will stay open when getting anything in or out...I have it setting in front of my master bedroom window and I can sit on it to put on my shoes, boots, etc. ..I plan on buying another ottoman for my guest bedroom to store the bedding...this ottoman looks good enough to be in my livingroom..."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Beautiful musical snowglobe. Very colorful with all the disney characters and great detail. Makes a nice addition to our Christmas treasures.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,These are absolutely great to use for the summer and winter.  I also have a large one in my bathroom.  The plastic ones are also great for making a nice gift.I have had this product for about a year now. It is very light weight and it holds a lot of food. It is very easy to store and I can use it on
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,Bought these for husband and he loves them. Less waist and just enough spray of cologne.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Searched for a hard surface vac for weeks to a better job on my hard surface floors, wood and porcelain tile...reading reviews on numerous vacs from $$ to $$$.  I actually got down to 2 Bissell, and decided to go with the bagless. Placed my order and it was here in a day it seemed.  What a great little vac....!!!!  Super power but with a button system conveniently located on the handle to reduce the suction to do my rag rugs and not suck them up...tools I most use, crevice and little brush right on handle...easy to dump, other filters easy to get at if needed.  Cord rewinds.. love the hard surface tool...little soft brushes that get the dirt but take care of my wood floors.  I notice I no longer have to go back over the floors with a dust mop to get the dust, this little sweeper gets it all.  Price is absolutely right and I was prepared to pay much more.  Very light weight but follows along with me fine...I have to move the cord a few times but no big deal, wand has plastic hook that sets it right on vac neatly for storage.  Think a really nice product that works well for what I want it to do."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"Not a security light.  It does not produce enough light.  My iPhone makes more light on flashlight mode.  I hung it center above my two car garage.  It looks tiny and a little ridiculous.  The guy that bought 10 of them to line his fence looks cute though, but I am not interested in spending $50 for these."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"I had a couple of issues with the design, which I will admit was due to the fact that the two adjustable blades are plastic, which is not the case with this model. The saw is well made and will cut your projects as you wish. The saw itself is not as sharp as a saw with a single adjustable blade, but it's not that sharp as a saw with two adjustable blades. I highly recommend this model. I have a few other saws that are very similar to this model, but I would prefer the two blades. Bottom line:  This saw is a great value. It's not cheap, but it's a good value. I would definitely recommend this saw to anyone."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I can't count of the number of times I've been able to squeeze into a tight spot with this ratchet.  It has a nice sturdy construction and the thick ""grippy"" handle lets you spin it even when the handle is at nearly a 90 degree angle."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,I received this product with an expiration date for last April. Didn't work well. The yeast didn't activate. I am very disappointed with this product.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This blender is excellent!  Engineered well and built well.  I have used a lot of blenders in my life but this one really blends whatever you toss into it. If the lid is not secured properly it will not start (nice feature)!  Lots of power = lots of noise...this has both.  Also, this lower blade is integrated into the pitcher, unlike the other models that screw into the bottom of the pitcher and eventually leak.
Suction cups on the bottom really stick this blender into the counter keeping it from moving...nice touch!

So why not five stars????

Not only does this blender not work with any of the Ninja single blending cup accessories it is not advertised as such.
A call to Ninja confirmed this.
Would be nice if I could use the Ninja single serve blending cups.  The single serve cups allows you to store several days worth of your blended batch into these cups.  The cups can then be placed on the blender and blended individually...(they have a mixing blade on each cup).  If you want this option you need to order the BL830."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"These booties have come in handy as I've had electricians and plumbers doing some work on the house. I have light colored floors that show dirt easily so these kept the floor clean. The workmen were surprised I had these booties but they wound up liking them so much that they took the them for future jobs.

The booties are very well packaged in separate cylinder bundles. This is convenient so you can keep in attractive containers by the door, ready to be used by your guests. The little bundles themselves come in a plastic bag, nothing fancy.

The quality is good. They have light treads though not sure if they make much of a difference in grip.

The only thing is that you have to get over your initial embarrassment at asking people to put them on. Still, it's better than asking folks to take their shoes off."

Actually, sometimes I find myself turning the light a certain way because its too bright to read the label.  I didn't realize it has low/ high side which is nice and easier on the battery life.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This is a comparison of 3 travel mugs I own: Contigo Snapseal, Contigo Autoseal, Thermos King.  I only use for hot coffee.

Temperature:  The Autoseal is king hereit holds the temperature ridiculously well, due to the combination of the lock on top and the finger button on the side.  Its a clear 5 stars.  King is second, with Snapseal right behind the King.

Size: The Snapseal holds more, without being cumbersome, so if the 20vs16 is important to you, this is a bonus.  The King is better than the Autoseal for one reason to me- it fits under the 3 Keurigs I regularly use.

Use:  The King is indeed king herethe slide switch is easy, and the deeper lid means spills are captured easily.  Also, you can slide it open and then drink at your leisure, without holding a button downand it comes in handle and non-handle versions.  The Snapseal is a 4 star herefor the first 1/3 of the cup, its smooth, but after that, it tends to spill a little, and no button required here either (plus it has a nice side grip).  The Autoseal is a 2-star herethere is almost no room for spillback, and you have to push in a button every time to release a liquid (hence why it probably keeps liquids hotter).

Cleaning:  All are pretty easy to clean, although I get the best warm-and-fuzzy from the Autoseal, since the bottom part snaps loose on a hinge to allow the suds to get into more parts.

Bottom line- if temperature is your thing, and you're ok with a button and some small spills, go with Autoseal.  If fitting under a Keurig and a good balance of temperature and use are your thing, go with Snapseal.  If ease of drinking with good temperature control is your thing, go with the King.
Or do like me and have all 3!"

The battery charger is very reliable and it's well made.  The battery charger came with two batteries and one charger.  The battery charger was a little more expensive than the one I had.  The charger was so light that I didn't need to pull it out of my pocket.  I like that the charger is portable and it comes with a charger.  The charger works well, and I haven't had to worry about it breaking.  It's definitely a good charger, but I don't know how it will last.

I like that the very first time I used it I felt it was going to break, but I'm not sure how long it would hold up.  I am still using it, but it's kind of stiff and takes up space, so I'm not sure how long it would hold up.  I'm a bit concerned it will break in the future, but the only thing I don't like about it is that it's not really a very well made product.  I will probably get a second one for the bedroom as a gift.I love this crockpot!  It's easy to clean, it has a removable lid so you can keep your pot from burning, it's easy to clean and I can use it on my stovetop.  I don't have to worry about it burning up!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Beejays has this wonderful easy to use spiralizer. It helps to minimize the prep time for your food preparation. Spiralizer is sleek and durable. It is compact enough to fit in your kitchen drawers. It comes with a cleaning brush and a free rotary peeler. This peeler has three blades for various cuts. It has a smooth surface, a small size ridge maker, & a large size ridge maker. This would be great for cutting potatoes into ridged potato chips.
  You use firm veggies to work best in the spiralizer. I used potatoes to make a mashed potato dish; carrots, cucumbers, and sweet potatoes to make a veggie stir fry; and also made a spiralizer veggie salad with pasta and Italian dressing. They were all fantastic additions to my meals. This spiralizer also comes with a free recipe book to help you on your way to eating healthier.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I am a heavy sleeper looking for an alarm that will wake me up and give me that extra boost in the dark fall and winter mornings.  I have had no prior experience with these types of wake up lights, but decided to give this one a try through the Vine program.  It works for me and I love it.  This sleek, light-weight clock is about 7.5"" in diameter and runs by an electric adapter.  The time and alarm are easy to set with clear picture instructions.  About 30 minutes prior to the alarm time, the light slowly starts coming on, increasing in brightness until the alarm goes off.  To have the best effect, the clock needs to be close to your head, say 1-3 feet.  The light is surprising bright when set to maximum of 10, so bright that I wake up 15 minutes before the alarm goes off.  You can set the brightness to less if you like, but since I am such a snoozer, I leave it at max.  The alarm itself is plenty loud also.  There is a snooze feature, you tap the top for another 9 minutes, but with the bright light, hard to keep sleeping.  It can also be used as a light at night, avoiding clutter on the nightstand.  Only feature I would like to see is battery back up in case of power failure.  Have been using this now for a few weeks and feel more awake in AM with that extra light boost."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"I've switched many of the bulbs in my home to LEDs but unfortunately there are still some fixtures to which there is no LED equivalent bulb for, such as the 100W incandescent ones. I chose Philips bulbs because they generally produce high quality bulbs and such is the case with this CFL, unfortunately one of the downsides of CFLs is that they take time to warm up. This bulb turns on and looks to be about 60% of maximum brightness for about a minute. The gradual increase in brightness is slow enough you don't actually notice it, but once the bulb is warm you can turn it off and back on and it goes back to 100% brightness. The color representation is good and it is slightly brighter than the equivalent 100W incandescent bulb while only using about 1/4 of the energy. Since the cost is about 1/8th of a 60W equivalent bulb it's a good value proposition. 3/5 stars because it's not perfect and form factor is slightly larger than a traditional bulb so it doesn't fit in fixtures that use lamp shade harps. If Philips could make the size slightly smaller and make the warm up time better I'd give it another star."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"$50 at the big box hardware store, or less than half that for what is functionally identical?  Seems like a no-brainer, but I was concerned about the quality.

I built in a huge custom dresser in my wife's closet and needed sturdy hardware.  The drawers are 45 inches wide, 23 inches long, and 11 inches deep made of 1/2 and 3/4 inch wood.  A nearly 4 foot by 2 foot by 1 foot drawer is ridiculously heavy and requires two pulls per drawer.  I was worried these less expensive pulls wouldn't be up to the task of hauling such an enormous drawer out of the wall, but my fears were unfounded.

They feel identical to the $5-each pulls at the hardware store, and even came with two different length screws to install them!  Bear in mind that there is no template for drilling holes, but frankly I would have thrown that out anyway.  The holes are 3 inches apart on-center, so just get your level and a tape measure and you're in business.  The screws have so far been able to hold the pulls in nice and tightly, and the metal seems reasonably hard.

It is easily machine washable, though may require another treatment after a few washes to keep the stiffness and water resistance.

It falls just about at my knees, a perfect length in my opinion. The pockets are well crafted, but could be a little bigger.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"The OxyLED SL30 is a shining star in the field of compact LED outdoor illumination. I have purchased over a dozen small solar powered outdoor lights in the last few years. Whats not to like in a light that powers up from the sun and helps you see things at night that might be prowling through your yard? The eight chip light panel is rated for 100 lumens, seeing it at night and comparing to an 80 lumen LED flashlight I would tend to agree that the output is correct. You get a nice clean white light with a good spread. No it's not a 300 watt halogen - but at the Amazon price you can build a nice simple array of these to either light a path or walkway. I used double stick tape and applied it to the metal fascia of my shed. It gets full sun most of the day and it lasts an impressively long time into the night. Without too many full brightness triggered events the light ran all night.

All night on a solar light is NOT the norm. I have a dozen models of lights from the local Menards and they won't give a reliable four hours on a charge, one season of weather and they are all junk. The only other path light I use is made by GE and runs about $35/light and can make the overnight haul with power to spare. I am going to add several more SL30's to the line posts on my fence and see about creating a ring of solar lighting around the yard.

The only thing that could make this better would be a remote solar panel. I have a few areas that just don't get any direct sun and a LED unit like this would be perfect with an 8-10ft panel extension."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"Came apart completely. Blew Across the Kitchen after 4 uses. Its 90% plastic 10% metal Certainly not the quality I expected from the great MOEN which costs 6x as much as a cheap Danco. No wonder an illustration is shown not an actual image of the item.  I will add my own.  I thought the bottom portion would be a beautiful chrome.  NOPE.  1970s kitchen plastic!

The concept is nice.

I did love the way it will stay in the spray mode, you don't have to keep pulling down on the fitting to move it from solid flow to spray time after time like you do with all the others on the market.  Yes its swivel hips moved smoothly as the gears in a great engine, the twelve hours I owned that is.

BUT
- lot of good it did to have all of the nice features when all of it disassembled and bounded across the room.  I tried repeatedly to re-seat it but things kept getting worse.  With the upper fitting being totally plastic every time you grip it especially with pliers its soft threads (whether you protect it with a rag or not) get more misshapen and you can forget ever getting it back to working order if this happens to you.

I had never had one come apart like this.  I didn't even know that the insert which you screw to the faucet was also threaded at the bottom and connects in screw fashion to the swivel element too.  I assumed that area was soldered or otherwise adhered.  Well in this Moen it was just threaded on so when the threads came undone they came undone in two places.... the upper end toward the faucet  and toward the bottom piece!  Ka Boom!"

-Knife blade
-Scissors
-Phillips & flat tip screw drivers
-Tooth pick (I am always looking for a tooth pick. People with braces will also appreciate it).
-Cool color (traditional red's nice, but kinda boring).

I like the other features as well: tweezers, awl/punch, can opener, and parcel hook which I use for pulling tent stakes.

Excellent quality, nice features, nice price. It's got enough tools to be useful in most situations, yet small enough to carry in larger pockets.

************************************
UPDATE 4/6/15:
Since this review I have collected several dozen more SAK's. I just love them. I have decided that I prefer the Climber models over the Super Tinker for the following reasons:

-The Super Tinker's Phillips driver is in an awkward location (in the middle of the knife rather than the end).
-The Phillips on the Super Tinker is redundant because the Can Opener suffices quite well as a Phillips driver.
-Replacing the Super Tinker's Phillips driver with the Corkscrew and concealed Mini Driver adds two extra tools to the same compact design.

Regardless, I still do love the Super Tinker. But I feel there's a little more functionality in the Climber."

They're colorful, fun, and durable at a low cost, and the size is perfect.  My order was received on time and in perfect condition.  I'll probably be back for more next year."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"So glad I found these. The quality is good. I also like the fact that they have two adjustable blades. The blades are designed to be ""turning"" so that you can adjust the angle in the direction you want it. This is a great feature for the price. I have a few of them in the house and they are a little heavier than I expected."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,This mixer saves me so much time and effort.  It handles an 80 lbs bag very nicely.  Does good with 2 80 lbs bag after you get it started.  It tends to loose some mix on its initial rotation.  After that it mixes it great.  Assembly instructions were hand drawn so good luck with that.  I had to redo mine 3 times during assembly.  I wish the power cord was a little longer because I ripped off the ground prong trying to move it while it was plugged in.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"I've used a few timers and have never had a problem with them.

The only downside is that the timer seems to be a bit too small for my liking. The light is so bright it can be heard in the dark. The size is not very useful for such a small light.

The only real negative is that the timer is too small to fit in my pocket. I just put it in my pocket and it is on my belt. It's very easy to move it around in my pocket. The light is too small for my liking.

All in all a great product and a great price.I was skeptical at first but after a few months I was very impressed with this little light.  It looks amazing and I can tell you I am very impressed with the quality and the light quality.  I have no complaints about this light.

I have a few other reviews that have stated that I have a tight spot on the back of the light and the small size makes it difficult to see in the dark.  I have seen this light used in a commercial kitchen remodel.  I will be putting this in a couple of kitchen fixtures for the kitchen that I have in my living room.  It is very quiet and the light is very bright.  The light is very bright and the light itself is very compact"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Thought I was stuck replacing my 30 year old vent unit due to bearing rumble in the fan motor. The local electrical shop said they couldn't find a replacement. Was more than willing to gamble on this as a replacement when I saw it. As others mention, the vibration isolation is not as good on this as it was in the 30 year old model so it's a little louder, but great compared to the bearing noiseI've been living with for years! My old unit had a stud that held the grill in place where this unit only has a hole. The clearance under the bracket made it difficult to find a bolt (used a panhead & filed it down) that would clear the motor.
It touches the motor and transfers Vibrations to the grill. I think sometime when I feel like messing with it I'll put a NutCert in the bracket and lock tight a stud into it, but for now it's fine and I didn't have to crawl around in the attic insulation to fix it!

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"Eh, it's just okay. Sometimes it punches, and sometimes it doesn't. Very finicky. I'd recommend just using a manual center punch and a hammer until you're ready to spend money on something from Starrett or another brand like that."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"A tad pricey, but it's worth it. If you're going to do a lot of right angle pocket holes, I recommend it."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"So here is how this device operates.

The controls: If you look at the picture you will see there is a lever on the side of the body, and the main pressure switch is on the sloped part in the back. The battery loads via threading off the front lens, and a small twist there disconnects the battery for storage or whatever. The main switch has 2 modes. As shown with the white circle showing the main switch has two functions; if you tap it quickly, the light stays on until you press again. If you hold for any time at all, maybe about 1/2 a second or longer, the light assumes you want a momentary function and will then switch off when you release it.

If you rotate the switch to the other position, the light is momentary only. The switch is easy to manipulate but does not seem to be prone to accidental movement at all.

There's also a little loop that you can push up to protect the main switch.

The mount: The rail mount needs probably a 3 groove section at least, but ideally you would have 5 grooves or so. It's a hinged clamp that's spring loaded closed and also has a thumbscrew to 'lock' the clamp onto the rail.

Basically every aspect of this thing is well thought out, simple, and functional.

This is probably the best thought out weapon light I've ever used."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,I've had one of these for a couple years now and I'm very happy with the result. It is so bright and the light is so small that it feels like a flashlight. The only thing that I don't like is the thin plastic clip. This one is still very good for the money.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"Love, love, love. As some reviewers have mentioned, the finish is a bit on the thin side, and the bottom is not very smooth. The bottom is also slightly sticky, so it is not a big deal. The outside is a bit rough. I was worried it would be rough, but it's not. I will probably get a different color and finish. I love this product. It does what it's supposed to do. It's easy to clean, and I don't have to worry about the coffee getting stuck in the bottom of my cup, or anything. I've found that it is a bit difficult to clean because of the plastic coating. I'll be returning it. The color is true to the picture. It's not as bright as I was expecting it to be, but it's not as bad as I expected. I love it. Works great. Easy to use. I used this for a few days and I am very happy with the results.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Works well with most Z-Wave home automation systems; I'm using this with Vera. The lock itself is solidly constructed and can hold up to a lot of use. The drive system has enough torque to operate the lock when used on ill-fitting doors, hasty installations, or when the door is being pushed while opening or locking. The keypad is easily visible in all kinds of light. Battery life is excellent. Has decent enough range to be used a good distance away from the home automation device or other Z-Wave devices without needing a repeater, so it works well for back doors or doors on different stories of the house. Comes with high-strength hardware that will require slight reworking of the door jamb in order to use, but is worth it. Codes are easily added, changed or deleted, with temporary one-time use codes as an option. Numerous other settings and features for alarms, tamper detection, general lock operation notifications and more. Installs like any other deadbolt."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Streamlight's UltraStinger is really in a niche by itself.  Mag Light's rechargeables aren't as bright and SureFire's are much more expensive, so the UltraStringer is really made for someone desiring a quality light that won't break the bank.
Some of the nice features of this light: It's very lightweight, very bright (75,000 candlepower), run time is very good for this much light output.  Well made, quality construction.
Some of the cons about this light:  Plastic lens (seems only SureFire will give you a genuine Pyrex, glass lens these days) and the spot/flood range isn't really that much of a difference (Mag's spot/flood produces a SPOT or a FLOOD).  The Streamlight has a very coarse adjustment range, really being all the same style output, with very LITTLE difference in the SPOT / FLOOD.  This isn't as bad as it sounds as the light produced is a very good, pure white light, I'd just like to see more variation in the range, but I'm being picky here.
One thing's for certain; this light is much better than Mag's rechargeable and a lesser light than SureFire's 8 or 9N rechargeable.  But, it's also half the price of the SureFire and 80% less than SureFire's 10-X.  So, I've got to give it 5 stars for being a great value, occupying a market not really served by either Mag or SureFire.
If you're a contractor or home inspector, this light is THE value on the market in a bright, quality constructed rechargeable."

However, with this vacuum, cleaning is actually kind of fun.

They're beautiful and classy looking glasses, though they do feel very delicate. I'm always very cautious when washing them. I've had them for a couple of years now though, and they've held up well."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,These are great and work with the Neato D80. I contemplated getting a generic brand but after thinking it through and ordering and comparing the Neato replacement filter with this brand I decided to go with the brand. I found that the material used to make the pleats of the filter were of higher quality than the original filter however a note to this is that filters on these units will get irreversibly clogged up with dirt and you will be better off replacing the filter after about 20-30 cleanings depending on the composition of dirt on the floors. That said the filters are consumable items and being able to purchase these filters at a lower (approx. 1/2) price meant that I could have more of them. The extra side brushes are also a needed item because like a little pet there is no telling where the side brush may come off the unit.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,I've used my Cuisinart immersion blender for the last 10 years and it's still going strong.  It is so easy to use and clean.  The blades are a nice feature and it's easy to clean.  I've been using this blender for about 10 years and it still does the job.  I have a few small kitchen gadgets and I've had to buy a new one.  I'm very happy with it.  The blades are smooth and a good size for chopping vegetables and fruits.  It's not hard to clean.  I'm very happy with it.  I will be purchasing more of these.

Not only do you have the option of the amount of light that it puts out, by determining how many candles you light, but this can boil water, make coffee and even cook a meal on it.  Very versatile.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I've read so many forum streams about ""skirt or no skirt"", which toilet is the ""best"" and so on, it too me a few hours to digest all the feedback. However,  I especially wanted a toilet that doesn't give me grief when I clean it. I am very happy, no, I'm ecstatic about this toilet. Yes, it probably cost more than perhaps a standard toilet, but it s finally something that I enjoy cleaning - yes, you read that right ""ENJOY""! It also goes will with our modern bathroom design and we wanted a ""short"" toilet because of space restrictions and this one fit the bill perfectly. It functions fine with the two flush options. And I like that it toilet seat closes slowly :)

Let me give a shout-out to the many people in forums and on Amazon, who helped me with their feedback. It has been exhaustive to read all about toilets (but thankfully most of us don't need to do that very often!),  and it did indeed help us make a decision. We can't be happier with the choice we made - so, thanks everyone!

Price on Amazon was very competitive and it arrived in two pieces. Our contractor hadn't installed one of these yet, and it was different to what he was used to. But it seemed to be quite easy!

Does not come with a toilet seat, but this one works nicely for us: TOTO SS114-01 Transitional SoftClose Elongated Toilet Seat, Cotton White."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These curtains have been in my bedroom for over a month.
For the first week, I had them completely closed. What a difference from my summer curtains!! Absolutely NO light entered through them!
They blocked all of the ambient light: I almost thought that I had gone blind!
I usually wake up in the middle of the night for a quick run to the bathroom. But, with the curtains fully closed and no light at all, I had a rough time finding my way back to bed!!
Since I retired, I no longer keep a clock in the bedroom, and rely on the light coming in the windows to gauge the time of day.
So, after that first week, I was forced to leave the curtains open a tiny crack to let some daylight into the bedroom!
In addition, these curtains are a tremendous help in keeping out the cold winds that we suffer in the northeastern states.
The material feels very soft - almost like brushed microfiber, and is very true to the color shown. The side facing outside is white.
In every respect, I am totally satisfied with the material and performance of these curtains."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"These pillows were no better than the cheap $5 pillows you can find at any low-rent discount bricks-and-mortar store.  Since the Dream Supreme pillow set cost far more than $5, I am extremely disappointed, and I've initiated a return and refund request with Amazon.

There is absolutely no neck or head support - those cheap pillows they give you on airplanes provide more support than these alleged Dream Supreme pillows. I woke up with a hideous neck-ache, which is not something I've ever experienced before.  Don't waste a dime of your hard-earned money buying these cheap junk pillows with a fancy expensive-sounding alias.  They're j-u-n-k.

I've also got a couple of different pieces of wood that I am using. It's all a good tool for the money. I bought this for a friend who has a house, he loves it, and is very pleased with it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I actually really like the look of it and when closing it it appears to create a pretty airtight fit.
Two things come across as a bit misleading though;

a) There is in no way a vacuum created or maintained, and
b) I can not see how it will allow for gases to escape.

Apart from that it's a neat looking container that appears to create a airtight space for my coffee beans.
Will use it for some time now to see how it makes my beans smell and taste :)"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,These glasses are amazing. They are heavy and solid giving reassurance that they won't break easily and the shape is exactly what I was looking for in a glass.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"I purchased this lightweight wonder from Big Lots for a great price. My 503 sq ft apartment, which has hardly any closet space, is too small for a heavy duty large vacuum. This vacuum is very easy to put together with only 2 pieces that go on to make it a complete upright vacuum. (No tools needed!)

OK but my SHARK NAVIGATOR LIGHT IS BETTER!
1. I cut my hair weekly with clippers and hair is either on the countertop or tile floors. The handheld got my countertops hair free and my tile floors were quickly cleaned.
2. The pet hair (white/brown shih tzu's long hair) was picked up in 1 swipe on kitchen tile floor, which usually takes me forever with my broom to get up.
3. The crevice attachment is amazing to clean windowsills, crown molding ledges, ceiling fan blades, and those spider webs in those hard to reach corners. Yes, my Spring cleaning began as soon as I purchased this cheap but helpful vac!
4. Cleans carpets as an upright but you will have to go over spots several times to get it squeaky clean and the suction is good enough to leave carpet lines.) By the way, my carpet areas are only 11x11 and 13x13 which the 16ft cord is just right! (For larger jobs I first use my manual Bissell Sweep-up and after picking up the larger pieces I use my featherweight vacuum. This keeps my featherweight from becoming clogged and preserving it.)
5. Quiet enough not to wake the entire neighborhood!

Needs some work:
1. The dust cup is small, which means you must empty after each use, and sometimes dust flies all over the front of the cup. Wet paper towel to the rescue!
2. Made of cheap plastic but what do I expect for $20!
3. No storage cup for the crevice attachment, but Velcro does wonders!
4. Needs a brush roll to get thru thick carpet!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,This brush saved my project!  I love the finish and the smoothness of the brush.  It is so easy to use.  I also like the fact that the brush is made of plastic.  It is not waterproof so it will not last long.  I used this for the first time to clean my paintbrush and it cleaned very well.  I think this is a great product.It works!

I had to replace a couple of the plastic plastic cups in the pitcher, but it worked well. I would definitely buy this again. I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one to become a new one. I wanted a different set of glasses. I decided to get this one because I love the quality of it. I would not recommend it to anyone. I love these for our dinner table!  We use them every day. I have used them for a couple of months now and they are just as good as the ones we have used at home. I can tell you I am very pleased with the quality and the price. I have used them for about a month now and still love them!  I have not tried the rustic ones. I use them to hang a sheet of fabric and the only thing I have not tried is the handle. I don't like it when I have to lift the cloth up to hang it and it would fall off the cloth. It's not a big deal but it's a problem when I have to lift it up and it's too small. I have tried using this one on my table and it works great. I've had this for about a month now and love it."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"I've used Krylon paint with great results before. However, this paint is not up to par. Firstly, I seem to have gotten a bad can. When I first removed the lid, I found it had already spurted out some paint (likely during shipping). I made sure the spray tip was clean and unclogged, but the spray came out all spattery and uneven (I have a very good finesse for spraying paint from a rattle can, and this can just sprayed really badly). Now that it is set up, with a full two coats and two days of dry time at optimal temperature, the paint still scuffs with the slightest provocation. Even a soft paper towel scuffed the paint. This is a primer/paint combo, but I still prepped my surface with a good sanding and cleaning. This paint just doesn't have the quality I have come to expect from Krylon."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Update:
What a difference a few hours can make!  I originally rated this blender at 3 stars earlier today and have now changed my rating to 1 star after using the blender a second time - after using it extremely lightly twice it cracked near the blade (see the product picture I've uploaded).  I was blending liquids so I can't imagine this thing surviving crushing things as the description states.  If you're smart you'll avoid this blender and pay a few more dollars for one that's more durable.

Original review:
This is a nice basic hand/stick blender.  The price was right for what I needed it for - purchased for soap making so I didn't want to spend a ton of money on it.  That being said, I'll probably look for a different one the next time around because this one ended up being bigger and more awkward than I was expecting and I have large hands (if I had smaller hands I definitely wouldn't like using it).  The end with the blade detaches for cleaning which is nice but the blade assembly itself doesn't.

Pros:
Price

Cons:
The whole thing is bigger than I expected and it's awkward to hold and use (you'd have a hard time using it in a glass to blend something small)
The blade doesn't come off for cleaning
Not durable"

The InSinkErator has a downward draft that drew refuse downward.  This does not.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I love these. The openings are a little wide, but I'm happy with my purchase.  The bottom is not very deep.  I also like the fact that the sides are adjustable so that it can be used in a variety of settings.  This is a great product.I bought this to put in my closet to store things in.  I didn't realize how much space it would hold until I put it in there."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"I first saw this tool, it was an inexpensive and powerful saw. I have a large collection of other tools and this is the one.  The blade is a solid, strong, straight edge.  It is not stiff like a regular saw.  I use it to cut concrete with no problems.  I have the most common type of saw and it is a solid blade.  I use it on most of my projects and for small projects.  It is very versatile.  I have had no problems with the saw.  I am very pleased with this tool.

Pros:
-Good for work
-Excellent for small projects
-Lightweight
-Doesn't seem to take up a lot of room

Cons:
-No grip on the saw, but it is sturdy

I have used this tool for a few months and it is still working well.  I have not used it as a commercial tool, but I am very pleased with the performance of this tool.

I would recommend this saw to anyone.

UPDATE: I have returned this tool.  I will be updating this review after receiving this tool.  It was not a failure.  I have been using this tool for a while now and I will not be replacing this tool.  I would recommend this tool to anyone.I bought this because I wanted a tool for my son's bedroom.

This knife is a little bit pricey, but I like that it is not expensive.  I do wish it were made of plastic, as it is"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I love the clear sides to view contents, and I love the way the dividers give flexibility in what size divisions are chosen.  The product walks the line between organizing content and losing storage space very nicely and feels durable enough to withstand being stored in a dusty basement.  I plan to purchase another one of these next year."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Home Depot added a store brand line of lower-cost LED bulbs and put their Feit bulbs on the clearance rack. I bought a package of 6 bulbs for $7.90,  installed them and was so impressed with the quality and brightness, I went back and bought four more packages to give to friends and relatives.  These are high-quality bulbs.

They FEEL sturdy. I like LED bulbs that have the ceramic ""band"" around the bottom.  They're less fragile and I have cats!  The metal base is solidly connected to the bulb and it screws in to the socket with a tight connection.  They come on instantly with no flickering.  The light streams from the bulbs in all directions so that you get full coverage.

And they're BRIGHT. I was hesitant to buy them because the package is marked ""warm white.""  I prefer ""daylight"" or ""natural light"" bulbs because they give off more light.  I don't want ""ambiance.""  I just want to be able to see where I'm going.  However, these produce a strong, natural looking light with very little yellow in it. They're supposed to be 60W-equivalent, but the brightness is similar to 75W-equivalent LED bulbs.

Because they're so reasonably priced, I felt that I could use them to replace the CFL bulbs in my basement and the difference is incredible. The four ceiling fixtures in my basement have uncovered bulbs, so I appreciate the sturdiness of the Feit bulbs.

I bought these locally and on sale, but the regular price of under $20 for a package of six bulbs is very reasonable, given the quality of the bulbs.  If you want strong light (especially in a place where the bulb may be bumped into) I think these are an excellent choice."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"I have spent considerable time reading the reviews and the instructions for how to make a dough dough, and I have found the best way to make a dough is to use a dough hook. The hook is made of a material that is thin enough to hold the dough to the edge of the dough hook. The dough hook is the most convenient way to use the dough hook. It has a very nice height for the dough hook to hang from and it is easy to hang when you are done. The dough hook is very easy to use. You can use it for a small batch of dough, or you can use it for more. The hook is not too big, but it is not too small either. The dough hook is also easy to clean. I like the fact that it is reversible. It has a little bit of a pull-out area for the dough hook to hang from and it is very easy to clean.

It is a great product, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good dough hook.I'm always looking for a lightweight rug to make my living room look great. This is exactly what I was looking for. It is heavy and it doesn't have the wrinkles. It is very soft and nice looking.

As soon as I saw the Clipso by T-fal, I knew that it would be the model that I would get the most use out of.  It is large enough for my needs without being too large.  The top goes on super easy and using the pressure cooker is as simple as reading the instructions.  Cooks great.  The rubber gasket should be replaced annually and knowing T-fal for a quality company, I am sure that the gasket will be available for a long time.

While portions of the pressure cooker are dishwasher safe, I will probably just continue to wash it by hand."

I had to order another set for my project. They are just great.

The only thing I would change is that the cups are a little smaller in diameter so it will be better if I use it for tea. I would definitely buy again. I bought this for my daughter's bedroom. She has a twin bed and she loves it. She's 8. I like that it's so easy to put on the bed and put the pillow on, and it is comfortable. I just wish it had a more center chest. She doesn't have a lot of room for it. I'm going to have to order a bigger one for her room, but she likes it. This is a great knife!  I have used it for almost a month now and it does a great job. I bought the knife from the manufacturer and I love it. I have not had any problems with it getting stuck on the knife blade. I use it to slice garlic and it is very sharp. I like the feel of the blade and the sharpness. I have never had any problems with it getting stuck on the blade. I have also used it for slicing onions and I like that it is a little more expensive than a regular knife. I am very happy with the quality of this knife. I love the grip of this knife and I would definitely buy it again. This is a very nice pot, but the lid is really small and the lid slides off when you take it out of the pot."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"PROS:
1. This allows you to get ""flatter"" against your work, so it's critical for certain tasks.
CONS:
1. Very cheaply constructed, and doesn't last long.  You'll need to replace these regularly.
2. Runs very hot and noisy.
3. Very difficult to install and remove from the main unit.  Not something you can just swap on and off easily.
TIPS:
1. Don't run it too fast, or for too long.  Let it cool off from time to time.
2. When installing and removing shafts (the rod with the disc at the end), insert a spare shaft through the hole near the tip of the angle attachment, to prevent the main shaft from turning while you tighten or loosen it.  If you use the button that's built-in to the main tool, you'll strip the gears in the right-angle attachment."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"this coffee maker is great for families that consume lots of coffee...

PROS: it keeps all of the coffee hot.
has a seperate button for those times you only need 1-4 cups...if you don't press this, coffee is not strong (water gets hotter with this button)
large capacity.
beeps when done brewing.
great look on counter!

CONS:1)large design, might be overwhelming in a small kitchen, also you cant really fit under standard sized cabinets, unless u pull out each time you want to make coffee, when you lift top to get to water area, the top will hit the underside of the cabinets.
2) hard to tell how much coffee is in it despite the Full/Empty gauge. beeps very faintly so u must listen in order to hear it when brewing is complete.
3) MAJOR ONE--you need to keep a microfiber cloth under the unit, otherwise the condensation comes out and seems to make the unit leak. also, when u pour water into the reservoir, you need to use a spouted cup to minimize the amount of water that falls out onto the counter...takes some practice, but worth it in the end.

BEST THING TO DO IS BUY WARRANTY THROUGH SQUARETRADE (online), THEY OFFER 3 YEARS ON IT, AND WILL FULLY REFUND PRICE IF IT BECOMES DEFECTIVE WITHIN THAT TIME! YOU DONT NEED A RECEIPT OR ANYTHING, JUST FILL OUT INFO AS SOON AS U BUY THE MACHINE.

Anyway, the stick works really well but doesn't last long as I had to constantly apply it even during the middle of ripping.

Jacket is soft to the touch, but appears durable. Arrived quickly and in good shape. BONUS: It's made in the U. S. of A."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I was very weary from using it and thought it would be a nice addition to the kitchen. It is so small that it is not worth the extra money.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,These work perfectly alone or joined together. The unit has a metal piece that is removable on the back so when you are taking your food out you can sit the lid on it.  Not needing to put it down on a counter.  Very easy to clean. Very well made nice quality construction.  The only negative thing I can say is on the dial there is only an indentation to mark if you have it on low warm or off.  I quickly resolved that by putting a little bit of white out in the indentation and that is working perfectly. These are available in different sizes. I have purchased many Bella products and I have always been completely satisfied. Always a good price for great quality.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"I bought the Griddler in February of 2005 and have taken care to ensure it lasts. The Griddler is heavy and sturdily constructed. It heats up quickly, and cleans up even faster. We have used it for panini, grilling meat, and toasting burger buns.  The unit can be used either as a panini/grill press with the floating top or opened up to use as a griddle.

The base of the unit heats up and maintains temperature better than the top. This creates uneven toasting of the Panini or other items. It's not so much of a problem using as a griddle, since one side will simply cook faster than the other.

After a year the nonstick surface has started pealing off of the grill plates. I have never used metal on the nonstick surface and have taken great care to preserve the finish. Perhaps it is in the design or a fate of nonstick coated products in general, but the now I will have to take care not to get pieces of the nonstick surface in my food.

The Griddler comes with interchangeable dishwasher safe griddle and grill plates with a lock and release system that is intuitive to use.  The plates easily release with the press of a button for cleaning.  To place the plates back on the Griddler, one simply rests the plates in the groves located towards the rear or bottom and snaps the front or top into place.  The plates don't consistently stay attached in the top section like they once did. It's very annoying trying to reposition a hot plate back into place.

On the surface, the Griddler has the looks and design to be a great product. Cuisinart has some bugs to work out to attain even heating and plates that last. If I were to buy a new panini press, I would not look to Cuisinart again.

The blades are very sharp, and the blade spring is very firm.  I love that the blades are made of glass.  I like that they have a clear plastic backing.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"We put this in when we renovated our kitchen wanting to have the newest neato tech.  It would work fine for a couple months and then go on the fritz, either not responding at all or randomly turning on when nobody was in the room.  I am pretty handy, I have dissembled, cleaned, and reassembled it several times now but it never lasts for long.  The whole system is based on the fact that when you touch it you ground it out, yet there are numerous components below the sink that are not insulated, and if they happen to touch something conductive (like, oh, I don't know, a PIPE?) it renders it useless or triggers it when nobody is around.  I went through several iterations of mounting the batteries up and away, insulating the pipes to prevent the hose/weight from touching etc all to no avail.  In addition, the soap dispenser that came with it is plastic crap, it's not even metal, just a facade that looks like metal, it broke within a few months.  Delta replaced that part, but still, do you expect a $300+ faucet set to break in 3 months?  I'm sure the Delta engineers would love to blame this on faulty install or an inept homeowner, but the fact is the product is not designed to handle anything but perfect conditions, and real life never is."

I remember my dad regularly winding the clock and for that reason always associated this model with him. Thus I was thrilled that I could buy a replica of an object that I associate with happy times. The clock itself has been running well for more than eight years. Changing the battery is a bit cumbersome as you have to unscrew the back two screws, but not a big deal. Just pop in one AA battery and you'll be set for a long time.

I took off one star for two reasons. This clock is, of course, a replica, and it's not nearly as heavy as my mom and dad's original clock. But it looks just like it regardless. Second, I think the ticking is a bit loud. I keep the clock in the living room because I like a quieter tick at night by the bed. Other than that, I have been well pleased with this clock."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Back when I first started leaning how to cook, I also learned I really hated peeling potatoes. Until I got one of those automatic peelers. It was great until the company that made it went out of business and I could no longer get replacement blades. But now I have the Peeler/Shredder/Spiral cutter from Nostalgia and I can cook again!

OK maybe it is not that revolutionary, but it is a great tool for your kitchen and it has so many more options than just peeling. You can Shred various vegetables and fruit. You can spiral cut too. You can even cut you own potato chips, at least you can if your deep fryer still works (that will be my next review).

The negatives are that it is made of rather flimsy plastic, so I don't know just how durable it will be in the long run. The storage in nice but the door does not close right due to the cheep plastic.

Overall a nice addition to your kitchen tool collection, especially if medical issues make peeling difficult for you. Also if you are a creative chef, the spiral cut and shredding options should inspire you to Iron Chef levels."

The only issue I have is that it is not as bright as the old one.  I put it in a dimmer, and it is still dim, but it is only about 10 watts.  I would be much happier if it was a little brighter.  It would be better if it was a little brighter.

The only thing I would change is that I have to turn it on for 20 minutes, then turn it off for 5 minutes, then turn it off for 10 minutes, then turn it on again for 20 minutes.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This flask is awesome. It took me a little bit to figure out where the shot glass was but after looking at the pictures on amazon i figured it out and quickly got the shot glass free from the flask. I love that the shot glass is collapsible you can this flask anywhere and have a shot. The flask is sturdy no leakage when tipped upside down which is a big plus. The shot glass fits perfectly on the side of the flask and comes off with ease. This is great for taking in the club with you instead of paying for outrageous drink prices slip this in your jacket pocket or purse and you have free drinks all night. Love the colors black and silver not to much but just the right beauty. All around this flask is great. Would make an excellent gift for fathers day or birthdays. I received this product for my honest review.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"We bought this steam vac for my mother-in-law since my husband broke her other hoover steam vac. We're quite happy to hear that she liked this hoover steam vac because it is easier for her to use and it is lighter than the old one. So with this, I want to try the steam vac in my own house to see if it is worth owning one. So I tried to do my daughter's room. It cleans pretty well! I am quite surprised on how it was able to make the carpet look brand new. And it is dryer than the old hoover ( though I still add alcohol to the water when rinsing to help evaporation).

The only issue I have is that it is using a lot of detergent. After reading online if this is an issue, someone gave a really good idea. Just plain water in wash mode first. Then wash mode with detergent/solution. Then rinse.
 It seems more work but worth it. Just washing with water took out some of the dirt already. Then with detergent, the dirt were basically ready to come out. I rinse the carpet twice just to be sure it is soap free.

So I will definitely buy this one again. Very handy and easy to use."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,Too much trouble putting up this film.  Followed Instructions but still could not take out the bubbles and wrinkles.  Worked on it over and over and still not so great.  The film would block the heat and sun okay but the trouble of putting it up and trying to make it look half way decent was not worth the trouble.  I need to find something else for my storm door and windows because of the frustration of putting up the film.

I just want to keep them in the house for when I need them.This is a great tool for small jobs. It works well for smaller jobs. I'm not sure why I got it for this price, but it's definitely a good value.I've used this one to get around a ceiling fan on my garage. I don't know if it's the one that I've had since I was a kid, or the one that I used to use to get around the ceiling fan."

They effortlessly grip like crazy yet don't mark, yet at the same time seem to be made of some kind of god like material that doesn't dent.

For those wondering how to find the size you need. Just put the plier in place with the handles closed, slide to meet the piece. Open handles and click 1-2 notches smaller to give you some leverage room."

I use it for cat treats, which are small, so it fits quite a lot.

They are a thin gauge thickness, and wouldn't be good for heavy electrical load. So nice to have 50' from front porch to far end of yard to place my Star Shower laser light projector. I bought two of them. I needed a longer one (80') for the far other end of yard, but I used an outdoor extension cord I already had to get it to the length I needed. I bought a heavy-duty outdoor timer that has 2 outlets for these two extension cords, so both projectors go off at the same time. Make sure you buy a quality timer that keeps accurate timing.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Got this product to do our upstairs (only area that is carpeted in our home). Ordered on sale, and got the item promptly through Amazon. Fast forward to 4 months later (we never took it out of the box) and opened it to get to work since we were expecting company. Instructions were horrendous, but finally got the thing put together. My husband and I couldn't figure out why the vac was not standing upright on its own, but kept falling backwards. Figured something must be missing and/or not put together properly. We dumped the Hoover box upside down in an effort to see if there were any missed parts and the only thing that fell out was a teeeeennnnyyyy tiny piece of plastic (think size of a marble). Turns out that little piece of plastic had a big job-it held up the ENTIRE machine. A bit stunned that some genius thought plastic would be good to use for such a crucial part of the machine, I called Hoover expecting them to stand behind their ""One Year Warranty"" that the machine came with. Explained the situation to a Hoover rep who assured me that we could take it to an authorized Hoover store for free repair. I was also confident since the machine was not even used once that the Hoover store could verify that clearly this had not been our fault. Wrong again. We got a phone call 2 days later informing us that the plastic piece that was broken was NOT covered under warranty and it would cost $120.00 to fix. ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?? Oh yes, let's pay for a piece of (*#&(W*#&( machine twice. I think not. This has been the worst experience and I will NEVER purchase anything Hoover again. Cheap plastic, poor design, horrible customer service. Lesson learned the hard way, hope others can learn from our mistake. What a joke!!!! Hoover gets a F- in my book."

Life is good!!  Haha. I now have my perfect 4 min. poached eggs again. Put a little water or butter in the cups and the eggs slide right out.  The pan is very useful for me.  I reheat food in it, make sauces, cook small quantities of anything.  Washes up easily! Cups wash right up.
I would definitely buy this again and what a fool for waiting sooooooo long to enjoy eggs the way I want them again!"

I am known to carry around a mason jar as my drinking glass on a regular basis. These glass mason jar mugs are right up my ally, so I was super excited upon finding them. They are perfect for drinking or using as packaging for gifts. They are wonderful as a base for decorations, the uses are endless. Each mug has beautiful detailing in the design and comes with a screw top lid. These would be perfect to use Christmas Eve filled with your beverage of choice, whether hot or cold. Or to fill with a nice surprise to give as a gift to a loved one. These mugs are each so gorgeous. The handles are comfortable to hold. The mugs are a nice thick glass, so I am not concerned of them breaking with light use. They are fine for the dishwasher, I always put in the top rack personally.

I received this product for free or at a reduced cost in exchange for my honest review. This is my unbiased, honest opinion of this product."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Ordered this when the faucet on my Brita Ultra broke. The color doesn't match (wish this came in white as well) but it works very well. There was no smell on this.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Very easy assembly. Set out the pieces and look at how the black clips fit together, then you'll be on your way to a quick and easy assembly.
The cutting board can be inserted either with the ""drip catcher"" grooves up or down. We have a small convection oven and a large toaster on top, so we chose to leave the grooves on the down side.
The top shelf is narrow but is nice for smaller items. The two larger shelves below the wood top now hold a cast iron dutch oven, a bread machine, two crock pots and a set of very large bowls.
The feet are adjustable so that you can level the unit so it won't wobble.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Let me start by saying I bought this to replace my Technivorm, which no longer was doing the job correctly. The Bonavita is half the price, and does the same thing: hot coffee at the proper brewing temperature, and quickly, too. My initial impression of it out of the box is that it is solid and very well made. Compared to Technivorm I would say it is just as good quality.
There are some feature differences. First, the part where the coffee goes sits directly on top of the carafe on the Bonavita. I find this a little awkward because it's hard to remove the carafe once the coffee is brewed; a little more clearance on top would solve this. Secondly, the carafe doesn't have that nifty lid like the Technivorm has, which allows the coffee to mix in the carafe. In other words, you have to stir the coffee after brewing in the Bonavita. Thirdly, there is no adjustable flow on the Bonavita. This is not a bad thing, as I was always having problems with the Technivorm getting plugged up during brewing (I use a permanent filter.) This doesn't happen at all on the Bonavita because it has just a hole set slightly up on the side--instead of on the very bottom--- where the coffee drips out. The only drawback to this is there is always going to be 1/4 or 1/2 an inch of coffee in the bottom of the ""brew cup"", which has to be poured out into the carafe. However,you never have to worry about coffee dripping out the bottom all over your counter every time you lift it off the carafe.
Overall, this is a great replacement for the Technivorm, which is frankly overpriced. The Bonavita is much simpler to operate. I am very pleased with this purchase!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,I think just about everyone else has the same problem. I have a lot of yellow stuff and the other two have the same problem. I have used the T-10 for years and have never had any problems with it. I am very pleased with the quality of the product.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Anyone who's owned one of these has never had to try this one.

The only thing is that it's very dimmable, which is not the case with the Kohler bulbs.

The light is in a large, multi-function light with an LED backlit mode.

The bottom line is that it's a great value and one I will be buying more of for my kid.

I used it to light up the garage at night and it works great!I bought this for a friend who has a house, and he uses it constantly.  He uses it frequently and constantly.  He doesn't have to worry about it getting scratched.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it's not bright enough.  I've had it for a while now, and the only thing I have noticed"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I was looking for a heavy-duty belt to handle my heavy, leather, tool pouches. It's not quite as heavy as I would have liked, but it does a more than adequate job. I have no complaints about it. It is a simple design and seemingly rugged in construction. I haven't worn it in the summertime, so I can't comment on the earlier reviewer's complaint that the color bleeds when you sweat. I am curious to see if that is the case."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I can't say enough good things about the quality and design of this product.  I have used it twice and am very happy with the results.  The plastic is sturdy and it does its job.  It is a good value for the price.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one to become a complete mess. I wanted a great item to replace a broken one that I had. I purchased this item for my daughter's wedding party. It works well, but I really needed a better one. I just wanted a great quality, and a beautiful one that would look great in the living room. It is a very good quality product and looks great in my living room. It is easy to put together, it is sturdy, and it is sturdy enough to hold my cookie sheets and our napkins in place. I love it. It is perfect for the kids in my family. I would recommend this product to everyone!I love this little spatula.  It is very easy to use, it is easy to clean, and it holds a lot of fruit.  The size is perfect for anything to use for.

I also tried leaving soaking in water with dishwashing soap for four days and the strong chemucsl and plastic smell remains. The bad thing is that the odor gets into the Q-Tips.

Beautiful design but not good product materials."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,CG,Product won't extend because the plastic has the plastic finish. I will say that it's been one of the worst experiences I've had with a cordless drill. This drill is very reliable and it's well worth the price. I would recommend it.I bought this to replace a broken one I had.  I love the fact that I can use the auto adjustability feature on the flashlight for my keychain.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I'm usually sceptical of 'aspects' (the materials in this particular model are not the same as the other ones I've seen).  I have used the Tumbler for several weeks now and it seems to be working just fine.  I wish it was a bit thicker and not heavier.  It's a good product and I'm very happy with it.  I like the size and the fact that it has a nice handle to hold it.  It's very easy to clean and holds a lot of food, so I would definitely recommend it.  I haven't had a problem with it and am happy"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Excellent and bad. The overall look of the lamp is just too dull. The light is bright and doesn't move. The dimmer is too small and the light is too bright. The light is not bright enough to be visible in a dark room. This lamp is still very bright. I haven't used it with a dimmer, but I have seen it with a dimmer. I have had it for about a month now and it still works great. It's very easy to program and to program it is easy to change. You can set the brightness of the lamp by either clicking on the ""LED"" button or by pressing the ""program"" button. The light is bright enough to see in a dark room, but the dimmer is too small. It's also too small for a 3/4 inch lamp."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"These are very cute stools, and I am very pleased with them.

The only downside is that the top is a bit of a mess, but you can't take it off without it sticking.  It will be fine, though.

I had to replace a couple of these, and the first one I used was just a little hard to get the lid off. I placed it on the bottom of the container, and it's pretty much a metal sink, which is great for storing things like paper towels, but I just didn't want to put the lid on.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"I wanted to be sure that it was the best. I did not need a replacement vacuum, but I wanted one that worked. The attachments to the box were a bit of a pain to install, but it was a good value. The size was perfect and the holes were very easy to install. The bottom was a bit rough, but the holes were not that big so I could use it to put my nails in. I am very happy with this purchase. This is a great product for the price. It works well, but I wish it was better. I put it in a refrigerator and it's working fine."

I would definitely buy again. Great. I like that it is so easy to store. I don't have to worry about it falling down on my counter or anything. It has a nice lid. I do like that it is not glass. I am very happy with it. I would recommend. I bought this to replace my old one that had a hole in the top. It worked fine for the first month but now the bottom cracks. It was very hard to install and the hole in the bottom was very hard to fix. It is very small and just a bit larger than I expected.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"...and get prior verification from the seller that you will receive what is advertised, and not a lower quality ""knockoff"".

I have purchased this item twice from Enzsmart. I received the product pictured and advertised both times from Enzsmart. A third purchase from another supplier (when Enzsmart was out of stock) was an inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" in almost all respects.

The foregoing my well explain the widely differing customer opinions of this and other popular China made flashlights, here at Amazon. To paraphrase Forrest Gump: 'Buying these things is like selecting a candy from a box of assorted chocolates. You never know exactly what you will get.'

At a delivered price of often under $11.00 these lights are a tremendous value. A bare, LED only, repair part CREE XM-L T6 LED will cost you about $10.00! Even the inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" was not a bad buy; but not what was ordered. Ultimately, I settled with the supplier for a 30% refund; but would have rather have paid full price for what was advertised. I will not likely use subject supplier again without prior assurance that I will receive what is actually advertised when I order.

{If the branded products received in plain white box packaging (marked FAH502B) were ""knockoffs"" or seconds; they were very high quality ones. By the way the UltraFire ""WF-502B"" is a actually flashlight body model that can accept several lamp modules. The ""XM-L T6"" is a specific model of the CREE brand LED that is claimed to be capable of producing about 1000 lumens @ 10 watts. CREE appears to sell inferior seconds or have counterfeiters that do not begin to equal CREE for quality.}

The model actually shown and described in the ad is a very powerful tactical flashlight. I do not possess the necessary test equipment to accurately measure its light output in lumens; but it actually draws about 9 watts at about 4 volts from a freshly charged 18650 cell. The real world light output is likely over 800 lumens, which is a lot of light for a compact tactical type flashlight."

The only reason I gave it four stars is that the plastic lid is too small for a tall container. I used this to make a little bread in the oven, and it worked out very well.

There are a couple of modes here that are nice, including the ambient mode which basically will not trigger if the room is already light enough, this is pretty great.  You can also trigger it on manually which is great if you know you are going to be in a room for awhile and are worried about the sensor picking you up (although this sensor is quite sensitive -- and has different settings for the size of the room).

I opened the box to find a well crafted cooling rack.  I had an older model drying rack that rusted and frankly was junk. I am pleased that this is made of stainless steel.  It is plenty wide enough to hold two round cake tiers without issue.  It has ample spacing to allow air to the cake, but are close enough to not damage our cake.  Best of all, the cakes removed easily and did not stick at all to the drying rack.  The raised legs allowed the air to circulate around the cakes.  Clean up was equal awesome! I rinsed in the sink, since there was really no cake on it and left in the drying rack. It dried sparkling clean. The cooling rack is also smooth. I ran my hands over it to ensure there was not any defects and to my pleasure, it was completely smooth.  I am so happy this came today and would definitely recommend the purchase to anyone who enjoys baking.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"I returned one of these and it was the best. I will keep my review for a couple months. If you want a nice, solid, clear, and attractive cover, this is the one. I have been using this cover for several years now and I always notice the shape of the covers. I love this cover! I also love the fact that it is a solid color. I love the fact that it has a nice, sleek finish. I like that the cover is removable from the inside of the case. I would definitely recommend this cover to anyone!

I was very pleased with this purchase. I would definitely recommend this cover to anyone.This is a very good, thick cover for my Christmas tree, and I love the color, the color, and the color is vibrant. I also love that the color"

She was pleased with this."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,They work great and fit perfect. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"This Power Port is great for low powered devices like charging iPods, Phones and running LED Lighting.
However, Things that draw large current won't work. Things like air compressors, air bed pumps and the like."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Installed easily and fit perfectly as a replacement to an older/cheaper fixture.  Looks great and hasn't had any trouble.  Great buy.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,CG,"This little light does crank on a little when you turn it on.  It's been a couple months and I haven't had a problem with it, but it's a little cumbersome to carry around.  It's a little pricey for what it is, but it's not that bad.  It's a good light for the price.I have a lot of CFLs in my home.  This one is a little bigger and brighter than I expected.  I love the light it produces, it is easy to install and works well.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"As stated in another review for an electronics-dimming product I've purchased on Amazon, these are quite useful though a bit overpriced in my opinion. I had considered buying a roll of automobile tint as it's cheaper but decided against it due to the worry it wouldn't cling as well as these and some tints have adhesive on them which would be a no-go for the intended purpose of using on electronics devices.

The item works well and the cling is good and fairly stable. It won't cling to everything though so keep that in mind and instead use a small piece of electrical or duct tape if you need to. I use this mainly for some electronics devices connected to my bedroom TV but also for my large blue LED alarm clock and it works great. I have only had to readjust it once or twice in 6 months."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Excellent value.  Easy to use.  Buy it.works great.Nice little light.  Works as advertised.  The plastic parts are very sturdy, and the cover is very sturdy.  The bulb is very bright, so it will be useful for"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Very bright light, I work a lot at night and i really like this light."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Yes! Saves my ears from wood shop noise as well as yard work machinery. I got a second one for my wife to use for her daily smoothie- the decibel level of that Blendtec is literally painful to my ears and can't be healthy to be regularly exposed to. She actually uses it!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Absolutely gorgeous.  Have it in my living room to hold our movies and games.  Love the size and the color.  A nice solid piece as well.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Fun ornament. Very well made with a great attention to detail. Good size too. It is a gift for my brother, who likes quirky ornaments and I'm sure he will love it."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,I bought these to use on my garage door opener. I also used them for the door opener.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,Ordered three of these lights and they work great.  I will keep them in the house and use them

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,We bought three other trash cans to replace a damaged one for our double trash can pullout. None fit right. Finally we tried this one. It's perfect and the company called me personally to tell me they had to ship a second can since ups damaged the first. I received a new can three days after their call.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,Great in-between size for medium and heavy duty work.  I will keep this in the tool box.I bought this to replace
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"They work, last long enough for my needs, sadly there is only space for two batteries on the charger."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I like this thing.  It does not feel as sturdy as I would like it, but it is exactly what I expected at this price point. I would assume that if I can avoid dropping it multiple times, it should last me many years.  I was using this as I was working on my house, prepping it for paint. I think I had it turned to the brightest setting for about 2 1/2 hours using the inexpensive alkaline batteries you get a Horror Freight before the light dimmed too much to continue.  The headband is comfortable enough that I forget that I am wearing it while working.  The ability to tilt the light is very nice because the beam pattern is pretty tight, and it would be tiring to move your neck to get the light where you want it.  I would recommend this light to a friend that needs it occasionally (once a week or less)."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,CG,"This fixture is smaller than the ones I bought locally. I will admit that it's been pretty difficult to get the light to fit, but it is the light that I was looking for. The light is in a large, multi-function light with an LED backlit. I love it. I have a portable light that I can use for a walk or bike ride. I love the fact that it has a LED backlight on it. I have two of these on my phone."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,CG,"Was not flat, so I had to make a long diagonal cut to keep it flat. The other two I had to cut, both with the blade out, were great. I have used this bulb in the past. I am very pleased. This bulb is excellent. The light is bright and very bright. I will be buying more."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Makes great coffee.  I used course grounds and have very little grounds in the coffee.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,This product has a flow control button and an LED bulb.  The light output is bright and the light output is very dim.  There is no light output indicator on the light switch so it is difficult to know when the light is on
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"INSTALLATION TIPS:
1. READ the Installation sheet! Even if you have installed other toilets. There really are tips that make it easier. Even so, it's still a hassle to install a toilet. Get real. And this one more so, because everything is concealed -- ""pay"" now, for years of easier cleaning, later.
2. Install the seat BEFORE you install the toilet. So if you want a different seat, have it on hand before the installation.

BONUS 1: It's almost like having a dual flush toilet. With just a quick push and release on the lever, there is enough water to flush liquid. For a thorough flush of solids, hold the lever down for the full flush. I find this traditional lever flush on the side of the tank easier to use than the push buttons on the top of some water-efficient toilets.

BONUS 2: The toilet tank is so much smaller, and the base of the toilet so slim and tidy, it makes this area of the bathroom look a little more spacious."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,So we have been drinking wine for the last two months and it's still beautiful! We just ordered a pair of the best bottles of wine and they are exactly the same. I love that we can order one of these at a time for one wine purchase and see the difference in the quality of the wine. We are very happy with our purchase and would definitely recommend this wine brand!This is a fantastic product. I am very pleased with it. I have been using it for a month now and the color is wonderful. It is very well made and the color is beautiful. It is definitely worth the money. I would highly recommend it. This is a great product. I have to say it is not the most durable liner I've ever used. It's a little hard to pull off the metal rod because the plastic doesn't stay flat on the floor. I have had it for a couple of months now and it is still working great. I just wish it had a stronger tip. I'll update this review if I find a better one. One thing to be aware of is that the base is plastic. It will not be strong enough to hold a wine bottle on. That's why I decided to buy it. The lid is solid and well made. It holds wine well. It does not leak. It does not bend. It is great for storing wine bottles and bottles. I would recommend this liner. I think it is very well made. I would recommend this liner. I did not purchase it as a gift.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,everything is great. no more bulky suction cups. My husband likes it too!  It is so easy to use.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,DON'T BEND THEM OR THEY WILL SPLIT.  THEY NEED TO BE MORE RESILIENT.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,CG,I had to replace two of the original bulbs because they were either dead or just too bright.  I had to replace the second one because they were the same color.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Good quality, no issues with material or hardware. No nicks, discoloration, or other problems that so many products suffer from these days."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"first, packaging was TERRIBLE. i know it's a large item, but it was put in two boxes (side to side) and taped with clear packaging tape. just for that they should get 2 stars. a kid would be able to package it better. just terrible.

- the edges always seem to have more paint left over than the middle. not sure if it's my roller or the design
- why is there a trough at the top? what's it for? maybe the brush, but i don't use it.
- holds a lot, easy to apply paint on the roller
- no liner available (that i know of), so it's a pain to clean up (see tip below)

one tip - leave more than a THIN film of paint when you are done, so that when it dries out, you can just peel it off in one swoop. if you try to get every last bit of paint, it's almost impossible to clean the next day (without water or solvents of course). when you don't see the green plastic and it dries out, it will be a piece of cake to take the latex paint off.

i'd buy it again."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Although it fit & worked fine, this part that was shipped did not look like the picture in the description. No worries! I replaced this upper and the lower unit and saved $600.00 based on the repair estimate!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"I haven't had too many issues with the quality of these bulbs.  These bulbs are bright and durable.  I had to replace a bulb that was running out of power.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"This chopper is perfect for keeping an open space on a small area.

The handle has a suction cup that is easy to use and is easy to clean.

I like that it is glass and not plastic so it will be easier for me to clean.

It is a bit difficult to clean because it has a metal handle and it is a little rough to use because of that.

I do think that it will be easier to clean since I have not used it yet.

Overall, I would buy this chopper again.It is a very good quality, and the price is great.

I would not recommend this to anyone except those who want to have a nice, small, large, or small kitchen.

I had a few complaints with it, but the ones that I have with it are a good deal.

My only complaint is that the handle slides out of the way when you lift it up, but that is not a problem with the other choppers I have.

The chopper is also very quiet.

I would recommend this to anyone who wants to cook a large or small cooking area.

I'm very pleased.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I wanted something that would last a long time without damaging the glass. I was quite surprised to see that the stainless steel on this one is a good quality, even if it is a bit too heavy for my tastes. I love that it is made of glass. It is super easy to clean. I have used it a couple of times, and it is still working as I hoped. I would definitely recommend.I bought this to replace my old one, it is a good size and sturdy, the only drawback is the metal rod is a bit too long for my small hands. It does not have the finish of the old one. It has a plastic grip that keeps the lid from being stuck.

I would say it is a good size and would be very useful for kitchen use, I would recommend it for the size of a large pan.This is a very nice gift.  I was looking for something to put in my little old mattress and it's a nice size. "
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Cosmetics are a storage challenge.  I have bought many different brands of cosmetics, and I have yet to find anything that is the same quality.  The basic design of these is very attractive, with a beautiful look.  The size is perfect for my collection.  I am very pleased with the quality.  I highly recommend these cosmetics.  I have not had a chance to try any other products from the same company, so I am not sure how long I will be able to keep them.  I am hoping that they will last for years to come.

I have a friend who has a lot of makeup, so I wanted to try some of these.  I was very disappointed that this product was not listed on Amazon.  I had to order an additional set of these, because the product description says it is made in China.  I will update this review when I receive a chance to try them.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I just opened the package. They appear to be thick and of good quality. The only downside I can see is that the raised spots on the front are hollow on the back.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"Summary: I bought the light in October. I had it until November, then it broke. I got a replacement in April after a dozen emails or so. The light was pretty nice though.

The light itself is really nice: small, powerful, nice-looking, exactly what I wanted. The accessories are good too. But don't be fooled by the 5 year warranty, unless you are ok with waiting for several months for a replacement.

The light stopped working shortly after the 30 day return period. No worries, I thought, I have 5 years of warranty from Olight, no problems at all. I contacted them, this is what happened.

10/08/2015: I ordered the light from Amazon.
11/16/2015: The light broke. I contacted them. They told me to unscrew the tail cap, disassemble and reassemble it and try again. That did not work.
11/19/2015: They told me that they'd send me a new tail cap.
11/23/2015: I received the new tail cap. That did not work either.
11/25/2015: They assigned me a RMA number and told me to mail the light in (at my expense). I did that.
12/09/2015: They received the light (according to USPS tracking).
01/19/2015: I contacted them asking what was going on. They told me that they mailed it back to the factory and that I should get it back ""soon"".
02/26/2015: I contacted them again, asking what was going on. They told me that they're sorry and that their usual turnaround time is 1-2 months.
03/29/2015: I contacted them again. They replied immediately and told me that the shipping was lost and that the light was discontinued. They offered me a free S30RII Baton, R20 Javelot or S2 Baton. The S30RII and the R20 are both more expensive than the light I originally purchased, and the S2 is about the same. I chose the S2 nevertheless because the S30RII and R20 are significantly larger than the S20R that I originally bought.
About a week later: I received the light."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"First off, I bought the whole package, UltraHD Lighted Work Center, the UltraHD Cushioned Pneumatic Work Stool and the optional 3"" wheels for the bench.

UltraHD Lighted Work Center: Easy to put together and very sturdy, LED work light and adjustable leveling feet. GREAT BENCH. And this is what I expect from Seville Classics. I also own 6 of their Industrial Wire Shelving Units and they are excellent too. It is what you would expect from a quality piece.

UltraHD Cushioned Pneumatic Work Stool: Very easy to put together and adjusts to the correct height for the bench. Do not overly care for the small back rest but it it ok. One small issue, it only has 4 wheels, they really should have had a 5th wheel, as it has already slipped out from under me once already. Be careful not to sit on the edge too quickly

Optional 3"" Wheels for UltraHD Work Center: Bad purchase. It not only raises the bench 4 inches, you are now sitting 4 inches lower on the bench. I am 5' 10"" and I had a hard time sitting above the table to work on items. I would save the hassle and $34 on these."

Both are jobs that can involve cutting, prying open, grabbing hot or sharp things, etc.  I saw this as a good tool to keep in my car to use ""just in case"" I had a chance to be a hero, like my friends. But first, I brought it to church to show my firefighter friend and get his thoughts. Here's what he said:

He thought it was a little heavy to carry but he thought he would be able to substitute it for a couple of other tools he carries. He liked the combo pliers/wire cutters and saw how they could be used to turn, bend or cut through wires or grills. He immediately recognized the key slot that could close gas valves. The pry bar end too could be useful to open stuck doors or smash windows. Finally, and the reason for only 4 stars, the fire hose tightened isn't very useful since he say that you really need two to snug up the joint.

Quality build, several useful tools, a little heavy, worth a try for the heros in your life!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"It's hard to find an actual set of these tools in the stores.  They are all pretty.  If you want to get a set that is as good as the ones I used to have, this is the one.  I think it's going to be a great choice for the money.  I have a few of them in the house and they are all so much more versatile and useful than the crappy plastic ones I replaced.  I'm hoping that when I buy another set of these tools, I'll have a set that does the same thing.

Bottom line:  These are really good.  I used them to replace the old tools that were replaced on the ceiling of my new home.  The old ones were too thin and didn't hold up well.  The new ones are much better.  I hope I'm buying a few more of these and they will last me a long time.

Update:  I bought two sets of these.  One set of these replaced all the old ones and the other one replaced all the old ones.  So, this was a very good deal.  The new set is much better.  I don't have any problems with the old ones.  The old ones were a bit stiff and the new ones are much better.  The old ones are well made and I like that they are plastic.  The plastic ones are more durable and more comfortable.  The plastic ones are good quality and"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"installed quickly, came with everything needed to make the job a snap.  All in all, a great product.I had a similar Schlage Hausfeld T20 Spyderco and this one came with it.  The size is perfect for my needs and is a great value for the money.  I have a Schlage T20 Spyderco on my garage door and this one is just perfect.  I installed the T20 Spyderco with a wire cutter and the motor was very easy to install.  The included hinge does not allow for sliding the motor out of the door frame, but it is easy enough to remove it.  The only thing I did not like is the locking mechanism and the door does not come off.  I have a large cabinet with a large garage door and this one is perfect.  I would recommend this to anyone.Easy to install."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Great, contemporary style in a stylish and elegant way.  I will be purchasing more!Very pretty.I bought this for a friend, and she is very happy with the purchase.

I am very pleased with it.This is a great product for the price. It works well, but I wish it was more sturdy. I just wish it had a more sturdy lid. I have used it a couple of times, and it is still working as I hoped.I got this to replace my old one I had. It's awesome. It's a great little product, the only drawback is the metal rod is a bit too long for my small hands. It's not really a problem, I've had mine for a few months now. My only problem is that the handle is too long for my small hands. I don't like it, I have a small hand.I purchased this for my daughter's wedding"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"expensive but I'd have to say this is state of the art in air filtration.

if you are going the trouble of mitigating a problem or concern with the air in your home not buying the best product available is wasting what ever is spent on a lesser product.

the added expense of this model is clearly value added in the controls, noise levels, and design of intake and exhaust.

the replacement filter cost is comparable to the single filter 400 series.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,My washing machine leaks and I cant find the leak. This is much better than towels under the machine. I also bought some anti-vibration pads to raise the machine up a bit. Works great with the pan.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Love the saw.  Does a great job at a reasonable price.

My only issue is the manual, and it's probably not the manufacturer's fault.  It's the lawyers.  With this litigious society we live in, you can no longer get a manual that tells you what to do and how to do it.  It's always a long laundry list of warnings and cautions.  Due to this, it's nearly impossible to search through the manual on how to actually do something, because that useful tidbit was wedged between the warning about using the saw on a fluorescent tubes and the caution against hand-holding it to cut down tree branches.

I'm pretty sure that if all the lawyer-speak was removed, the instructions would fit on a single sheet of paper.

I've discovered that if I set the blade bevel at 45 degrees, if I were to actually turn it on and bring the blade down, it would shred the aqua-colored plastic table inserts at the center of the cutting surface.  I've spent a long time searching through the manual about this.  Is there another adjustment?  Do these inserts need to be removed before cutting a bevel?

Edit:  It turns out I had a defective unit.  I exchanged it and the bevel on the new one works fine."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Work great and bright. These are not ballast compatible even though the box says they are. I called the company and reached someone immediately who confirmed that you need to remove/bypass the ballast. Not a problem as removing the lamp ballast and rewiring the light was a simple, quick and easy job. Not having a ballast means one less thing to fail. Another plus is that these LED lights do not get warm like the fluorescent did. I used these LED lights to replace fluorescent lights in under cabinet fixtures which would get warm which also warmed the cabinets."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I purchased this travel mug at Target a year ago.  I loved it so much that I wanted another one. I didn't want to pay Target's price, so I went to Amazon.com and found it cheaper here - so I ordered it.  This is the one and only awesome travel mug of all kinds!  The coffee stays hot for hours, it is truely ""leak proof"" - and I just can't say enough good things about this mug.  I purchased other kinds that say they are leak proof, and they were - but my coffee was luke warm within 20 minutes in my car. The Thermos stainless steel leak proof mug keeps my coffee hot for a long time (about 3 hours - went to a meeting and left this on my desk - came back 2 1/2+ hours later - and my coffee was still hot!).

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,CG,"I've been wanting a Starrett for a long time now. I'm a professional electrical guy and have always had an interest in the design of solid and flexible electrical devices. After a lot of research, I decided to give this a try. The Starrett is very compact and gives you the ability to hang your electrical devices on the wall, which is great for storing them in your pocket. The magnetic element has a very good feel to it and the design allows you to hang your device on the wall to protect it from the elements. The black felt pad is also very well made and the holder is super heavy and sturdy. The handle is very secure and the included charger is included. The charger is very easy to use and I don't have to worry about batteries. It's also a very nice feature that you can put the charger on the wall with one hand. You can also put it on the floor and hold it on the floor for a longer time. The charger has a very nice feel and is very well made.

The price was right and I'm very happy with it. I have used it on a number of projects and I'm very happy with the quality and performance of the product. The product is very well made and it is well made. I would recommend it to anyone that needs to hang your electrical devices on the wall.

I am very happy with this product and am very happy with the purchase.I have had this product for about a year now and it is still going strong. I ordered two for my sister and they both love it!They are a great size and well made.These are great. I just put them on my countertop and put them on the counter top of my coffee maker.  They are exactly what I wanted.  I use them to keep my coffee hot for a few hours or so and they work great.  I have been using them for a few months now and I am still using them to make my coffee.  I would recommend them to anyone who wants a quality coffee maker.  I have used them for a while now and I will be buying more.My only complaint is that the handle is a little too large. I use it to hold a lot of wine and it is a bit uncomfortable to hold. I also like that the handle is large enough to hold a lot of ice.I purchased this for my daughter's wedding and she loved it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Good quality, however, the fit is not correct for the pot size.  It is wobbly and loose.  Okay for my uses.  Handle does get hot as cooking continues so caution is advised.  The hollow button metal handles don't seem to have as much as an issue."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,"Bought this as a replacement for an old one that failed. Works great. Doesn't seem to be as bright as the new one. The light is a bit brighter than the old one.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,I bought this to organize and clear up space in my garage. Its sturdy and didn't take too much time to setup. No more clutter around the garage. I'd buy more of these for organization.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,I've been using the Saleae (Cordless) bulb for about a year now and I'm very pleased with the quality and the look. The light output is excellent and it's nice to have a little extra light to cover a small area. This is a great bulb for the price. I have a few of them in the house and they are bright enough to see in the dark. I have a few of them on my bathrooms and a few in the kitchen.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Really cute -- kind of like a disco ball, but with multi-colored lights. Surprised at how far the light reaches. And cheap! Great for a kid's party, but I have no idea whatsoever what purpose I had in mind when I bought it for myself.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Light works great! Did have an initial problem as batteries used were not fresh, and the light seemed to be defective. Put fresh batteries in and it has worked like a charm. Good sensing of motion, time on and brightness. You can not turn off or change settings which makes it simpler. Will order more for use around seldom accessed dark places. Wish they made a more attractive one for indoor usage."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,I have three of these of various specs and love them.  I wouldn't own any other brand.  Very accurate and durable.  These are built like a tank and come with their individual factory test readout.  I've used this brand for years and have never had a problem.  They cost more than some lesser brands but I probably would have had to replace a lesser brand many times over so I look at it like I'm saving money in the long run.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"I really like the look of this, the materials are thick and sturdy, and the handle is sturdy.  I had to replace a couple of the plastic ones, so it is not that big of a deal.  I am a bit disappointed.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,I did receive these as a promotion and I really like these gloves. They protect my hands from heat with a pot I took right off the stove and tried them by holding it in my hand. Didn't feel any heat transfer. The silicon grips are great too as I don't feel that my hands are going to slip. Have used them multiple times and they do not transfer heat. I haven't tried anything approaching the limit of 480 degrees but have taken pans out of a toaster oven where they are 425 and again no heat felt. They are a bit big (got the large) but I find that useful as I don't have to slip my hands in with a struggle. I have medium to large hands but the fit is probably a bit large. Again I find this a plus and not a minus. I would probably like the longer cuff for taking pans out of an oven but it is not like these are short and I don't think I will burn myself but maybe if you are a bit clumsy you might? I would totally recommend them even if I was buying them.

The pan is a bit difficult to clean.  The plastic parts are very hard to clean, so it is not easy to clean either.  The pan is a bit messy.  I don't recommend using this pan for a pan that is dishwasher safe, but I don't think I will be using it for a pan that will rust.

I'm really happy with this pan.  I'm very happy with the quality of the pan, but I really don't want to spend the extra money on a pan that will rust.  This pan is a great pan.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I was at first skeptical when I had purchased two of these for my two vehicles.  However, after using them on a 400 mile day trip, these units appear to do the air cleaning job.  My sinuses used to go south when traveling in our SAAB 9-5.  However, with the unit in place, my sinuses were not bothered by the SAAB cabin air quality.  And yes, the cabin filters are changed annually whether they need it or not!

However, when one of the units developed a connectivity issue, E-Mailed the folks at Green Giraffe who promptly replaced the unit without any fuss.  Had the replacement within days and no hassle.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"We had one of the lamps that would die after less than an hour but Amazon sent out 4 replacements along with a shipping label to send these back. The worst part of the lights is the sectional poles, they have a habit of leaning. I used pipe glue and shoved them all the way in and that helps a lot."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"Unit is plastic and seems to be well made. It easily fits on top of a 5gal bucket, but does not snap on or fit tightly.  Only when the vac is running does it ""snug"" down for a tight fit.  So, it easily comes off when not in use, which is aggravating.  Also, when hoses are attached, you need to have the bucket anchored in some way or it will be falling over every time you move one of the hoses.  Once the bucket gets to be about half full, then it becomes more stable.  None of that is really the fault of the product though, but is a result of using the product.

I am not overly impressed with it, but it works for the intended purpose.  Plastic holes for hoses don't look like they can take much abuse, so we will see how it lasts over time.  For the money, it is a good buy."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,really impressed with the price and quality of the tools. I will keep my review in mind when ordering

I have used them for everything from baking to using a coffee pot.  I use them to heat up the coffee, to make a quick pot of tea, or to make a quick cup of soup.  I just put them in the fridge for a few minutes, then put them in the fridge for a few minutes to get them warmed up.  You can also make a cup of coffee with them, and then put them in the refrigerator for a couple days to make sure they don't get too hot.  I have been using them to heat up my coffee for about a month now, and I love how they keep the coffee hot for a long time.  I also like how they are easy to clean.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,I am disappointed in these to be honest.  I liked them... LOVED them actually.  I put them in some sconces I have on my bedroom walls.  A little ambient light in the evening while I'm closing up the house and going to bed.. and a little romantic lighting as well.  They worked on the timer for about a month.  I got them on March 8th.  Put them up on the 10th and here is it April 12 and they have been dark for 2 days already some a week.  The batteries are supposed to last for over 200 hours.. I got maybe 180 lite hours out of them.  Really disappointing.  I guess they would last longer if I would have just used the remote every night but that was what the time was supposed to be for.  I guess I will just leave them in for now as decoration.  I am not going to spend 5.00 a month on batteries for them.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I recently returned  a Porter-Cable 9866 cordless drill because the chuck was annoyingly bad. The P-C would not hold a screwdriver bit and scored the shanks of several of my round shank bits.
I replaced it with the DeWalt 983 and there is no comparison. The additonal few dollars are well worth it. I did jobs identical with those I attempted with the Porter-Cable and had no problems. These jobs included drilling in stainless steel and even as the bit broke through the work the DeWalt did not stall and the chuck held the number 3 bit flawlessly.
I only had one surprise with the DeWalt and that was that the clutch functions only on the high speed setting. I guess this makes sense as I don't need much torque when driving screws and the high speed setting easily drives #14 screws. I own several Porter-Cable tools and they are all excellent.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"My late husband and I received this as a wedding gift in 2003. This coffee maker will grind beans, then brew, or you can just put ground coffee in it. For the most part, I just use ground coffee, but on occasion I'll buy whole bean coffee, and it works great. Some other reviewers have said that the grinding mechanism is loud, but I have a separate grinder, and it's no louder than that.

If you don't want to grind, just brew, there is a ""grind off"" button that you push before turning it on, and it just brews, without grinding- easy.

You can set it to make coffee at a pre-set time, and I've never had a problem with this- it's easy to set.

The coffee is brewed into a thermal carafe, and this works GREAT- my late husband would often get up around 6 am and brew a full pot. By the time I woke up at 8:30, it was still steaming hot, and no burned coffee from an under carafe heater.

The unit looks great and doesn't take up too much space on my counter.

The interior pieces come apart (basket, piece that holds the basket), and are easily washed in the top rack of the dishwasher.

Some people have complained in these reviews that they don't like the plastic insides, but I've had this machine for 4 years, and there's been no problem with anything breaking or malfunctioning in any way. There is also a mesh basket, which you can use as a filter, but if you remove it, you can  place a regular paper coffee filter in it's place.

I love that at parties, or on a nice day outside, I can place the carafe right on the table, and the coffee will stay hot for a long, long time.

I've had this machine for 4 years, and have been very happy with it. I've purchased several of them as gifts for people, as well- and everyone has loved it."

The only issue I have had is sometimes it takes 2 times of putting a hand under it in order to get the soap to come out.  I bought one for myself and my son and both are still working after 3 months.  That might not sound like much, but the others we tried quit after less time - some not at all.

We heat our home with a pellet stove which keeps the main part of the house very comfortable, but our bedroom is always cold. With winter arriving early, we decided to order the electric blanket.  It arrived exactly when it was supposed to and in perfect condition.  We put it on the bed immediately and turned it on high about a half hour before bed.  The bed was so warm and toasty when we got in.  On a 19 degree night we actually were able to get away with having the setting on low for the rest of the night.  It does have an auto shut off which is a very nice feature.  So you ask, why am I raving about this blanket and only giving it four stars?

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"These are cute and colorful silicone reusable cupcake molds. They will make a smaller than normal cupcake which is fine by me but may not be for everyone.  I found that if you fill the molds half way or more the final resulting cupcake doesn't much resemble a butterfly. If you only fill the molds about the third of the way the finished product will be smaller but will look like a butterfly especially when frosted and decorated.

These molds don't each hold the same shape.  They are fairly thin and do distort easily. They are a bit of work to clean.  My brand new dishwasher didn't get them completely clean so I suggest you wash them by hand, which can be a chore.  I will definitely use these again but not as often as I thought I would.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I was actually hoping to find something about half this size with the same purpose.  If I could find a wine rack that held 12 bottles and 8 glasses that would fit on my counter top, I would be ecstatic.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything like that.  And the two part accessories that provided that functionality would end up costing twice as much as this unit.  So after several weeks of debating and shopping, I finally decided on this one.  And I'm pretty happy.

First of all, it just looks awesome in the corner of my kitchen.  Plus, the extra counter top is a definite plus.  It is also very easy to put together.  It took me longer to get it out of the package than it actually took me to assemble.  But the biggest bonus is just how awesome it looks.  I can't emphasize that enough.

A few other reviews mentioned that it didn't hold many of the larger base wine glasses.  I utilize two different types of glasses, a rounded goblet for red wine and a taller glass for white wine (I don't drink sparkling wine...blech).  Both generic types of glasses fit perfectly.

My only complaint with this item is the fact that the legs were not perfectly alligned at first assembly.  If I had placed it on carpet, I would have never even noticed.  But it was on a flat, tile surface.  It wobbled just a little bit.  I suspected that this was the result of the torque put on the screws during assembly.  So I loosened all of the screws on the sides and then retightened them.  Problem solved."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"My husband loves to play his video games, unfortunately the couch is to far from the tv for him to play and was wanting some type of bean bag to use while playing. The chill bag bean bag is perfect!! Unlike normal bean bags this one is filled with little pieces of memory foam. The memory foam makes it extra comfy. It's 4 ft size and it easily fits my husband and my 4 year old. It comes in a medium size box and I wasn't expecting it to be in such a small box considering its size, the memory foam is condensed into a ball with plastic wrap around it, and the cover is seperate. Me and my two kids followed the instructions and carefully unwrapped the memory foam, once we got it out of the plastic wrap, I had the kids jump on it to loosen the memory foam and it quickly expanded. This bean bag is very sturdy and actually kinda heavy. You sink right into it and since it has memory foam instead of the tiny foam balls you can conform it to how your sitting. We love this ""bean bag"" !! When my husband isn't playing his video games and using it my kids are, it's a big hit at our house.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Arrived right on schedule - well packaged - this fan will literally blow you away.  It's somewhat heavy but appears very well made.  Assembly was a snap. I used toggle bolts to mount the bracket to the wall (3/16 x 3"") - I did need to open the holes in the bracket with a 3/16 drill bit - I always use toggle bolts when hanging something on a sheet rock wall and want to make sure the anchors don't loosen up or pull through.  As far as the downward angle - the downward tilt is about 45 degrees maximum - of you are looking for a fan that will tilt down further (like parallel to the floor), this is not the one. Otherwise this is an excellent buy.  The pull string on/off mechanism works very well - changes speed easily - no yanking. The 18"" diameter gives great air movement (not sure how many CFPM).  Checked the big box stores and couldn't find a fan that could compare. One home store carries a wall mounted fan that may be close in size and air movement, but costs over $200."

The set is good but I have a couple issues. First, it did not come with a tool to help remove Defiant round handles (Defiant and kwickset are interchangeable) These need a small round point and it only came with slot type tool. Second, and the worst part for me at least, the new keys it came with requires two of the same color pin for each key. This means I only have enough pins to rekey 3 locks instead of up to 6 it claims on the package. Now I need to make a purchase of a pin set that I shouldn't need. I will contact the manufacturer to see if they will ship them for free."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"Ok thid is garbage plain and simple.  My brother brought one of these sinks and it does have a hairline crack at the base.  However what struck me as horrid is the thin walls of this sink make it as fragile as a china tea cup. It's pretty enough but its walls are so thin the sink is lucky to last a year without a major failure. If you are John Q Perfect and never drop anything or have any bathroom mishaps this sink is for you.  If you are like most of us and are less than perfect in the bathroom please buy another sink.  While pretty this sink is as thin as the sides of a mug.

I see they are not asking much for this sink which is a releaif because in this case you are getting what you pay for.  This sink looks alot like a quality Porcher sink that I purchased here on Amazon.com.  the construction of my Porcher sink was first rate. The walls were thick fireclay construction.  The porcher sink was made from very hard fire clay and looked alot like this.  Key difference the Porcher sink cost me $600 and will likely last the rest of my life.  I brought two for my bathroom and they still look great.

This sink does look good IF you are lucky enough to get one that does not have tiny hairline cracks.  Often to see the cracks youo must look for them using a very bright light source  The sink is so thin I'm not surprised it has a cracking problem.  Vitrious China sinks are more brittle than fire clay anyway but when you design or but a china sink like this one that is built with sides and a base this thin I think you are asking for trouble."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,Poorly assembled. Wheel wobbles and material is under gauged. Don't waste your money. Went in trash after one use.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Makes may tea with out stirring. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I'm a software developer who recently decided to try out the whole standing desk thing. I hadn't seen many reviews for using the mat for this purpose, which made me hesitant to purchase it at first, but now I'm glad I did.

To get a feel for the usage so far: I don't try to stand the entire day but try to alternate between an hour or so of standing and an hour or so of sitting. It's only a month in, but so far it's held up from regular wear. You can't tell that it's been used at all.

The mat definitely helped with fatigue and back support. I have a few running injuries that normally would make something like this a little painful, but in the month of using the mat, those issues have mostly disappeared.

When I sit, I have a chair that seats as high as the desk is propped up. For the first few weeks I would move the mat under my desk and pull my chair over fear of leaving a dent in the mat. After a well-meaning co-worker sat in my chair for a while it was on the mat, it did leave an impression on the mat, but after removing the chair it sprang right back to the mat's original form. I'd say this mat will work fine for an office space that needs sit and stand."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Once you get used to the settings, it makes deliciously, moist meats!!
We seared our meat for just a couple minutes after cooking. It is a great kitchen addition and would highly recommend!
We put the seasoned meats in one sealed bag, veggies in another."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"They do what they say, but the quality is just not good.

The only one I can think of that is the plastic. "
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,CG,3 Days after installing I noticed a noticeable difference in the color of the light output.  This is a very bright light and
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Great big numbers & easy to read, the only thing I didn't like is the size of the"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"the first time I took it out, the wooden part was broken. The rest of the time, it was the best I've ever had."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,Be careful when you buy a fuse. sometimes it does not fit for yours.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,CG,"We've tried Brita, Pur, and some of the other brands. I'm not happy with the result, but I think it's a nice, solid product. The plastic is solid, and it's easy to remove and change. The cover is very thick, and I don't think you'll be able to remove it with a single finger, but the plastic cover is very thin. I'd rather have a cover that's not so thick, and not too thin, but I don't think that's a big deal. The plastic cover is a little too thick for my thumb, so it's difficult to remove it with a single finger, but it's easy to do that. The cover is fairly thick, and it's easy to remove it with a single finger. It's also a little heavier than I'd like, but it's not a big deal. The plastic cover is very thin, and it's easy to remove with a single finger. I'd prefer a cover that's not too thick, and not too thin, but I don't think that's a big deal. I've never had a problem with the plastic cover, and I'm happy with it. The plastic cover is very thin, and it"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Got for work white elephant. I love the look. My husband likes it too.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These are great. Came in handy when  it seemed like our new fridge wasn't cooling properly. Put one on the top shelf and one on the bottom; proved to the repair guy that temps were reaching as warm as 46 (hello, food poisoning) and as low as 28 (hello, slimy, thawed lettuce). Min/max feature is obviously a winner, but the whole design is good - easy to read display, easily switch from F to C... Recommended."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"The knife lives in the door pocket of my car. I've used it a few times. I give it a 4 because the fire stick is not very good compared to others I've purchased. Otherwise, it is simply what you expect."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,Good price for a good quality router.  Light weight and controls are easy to use and access.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Fit the RV Queen well...nice tight fit.  Would have thought the product would have been a bit thicker, in that the photos make it appear to be similar to terrycloth.  Having said that, it is not too thin and so far is not noisy like some waterproof mattress covers.  I did not rate it a full five stars because a) we haven't had a waterproof test yet (no grandchildren overnighting in the RV yet) and it is new, so value over time has yet to be determined."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,CG,Worked overall but still had some issues. Overall a good purchase.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"Softer than my more expensive, more expensive, more expensive model, I'm just not sure how"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Nice small ottoman that does what it should.  Not too big or too small. 
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"I really was disappointed when I received this.  It had white/gray spots on the inside.  Not sure what it was, but it looked a little moldy.  I used professional mold remover and a mold shield ( Zep Brand ) and treated it heavy for 2 days to make sure whatever it was is gone, and won't come back.  This fits perfectly in my Chevy Avalanche's Saddle bag, and hold's all my ropes, tie-downs and bungee's great!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This this faucet looks good and installs easily. If you don't have room under your sink to use a wrench to remove the old drain pop-up as in my case, just remove the drain-flange from the top-side of the sink by tapping it counter-clockwise with a small ballpein hammer and a nail setter. The new one will install hand tight without a wrench."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,this is a great pan. I have had 3 in the last 20 years. highly recommend. I would recommend and All-Clad products.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"It's alright.  The hair catcher doesn't stay put when washing hair in the sink, but this is just my situation.  This may work well for others.  The item is well made, with small ""teeth"" to catch hairs."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"Not impressed, but then what else can you say about these?

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"These were MUCH too small for most projects. Short of sealing a bag or sausages, I'm not sure what you would use these for. I purchased them to build cages, and they just wouldn't work.

On the plus side, they are comfortable and easy to use. I like the idea of the auto feed, much more convenient."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Bought this sofa for my class c motorhome.  IT was easy to assemble and it it quite comfortable.  The price was very competetive.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Bought these to use on the boat. Very excited to try with wine slushies this summer!!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I love this product. Its perfect for the price and it is a nice piece of equipment.  It is so easy to use.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,It would be cool if it had a wide area. I also love that it's been one of
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"These are also sold with a standard 3/4"" thick metal holder that is a little larger than a standard bulb. The plastic holder is also designed to be easily removed from the fixture.

The light is not bright enough to illuminate a room. This is a problem for most people. They need to have a portable light that can be mounted anywhere on the fixture. This is a problem for most people. I installed a 40 watt incandescent bulb at the end of the fixture and it worked great for a few hours. I use this light for about a month now and it is still working great. I would recommend this light to anyone looking for a portable light.This is a great lamp.  I have used it for years and I can tell you that it's a quality product.  I would recommend it.This is a good product.  It's small and compact, but well made.  It's very bright.  I use it to light up a room and it's very good.  I have been using it for several months now and it's always bright.  I'm very pleased with the light and the quality.  I bought two for our house and one for the basement.  The one I received was a little dimmable and the one I received was a little dimmable.  The two I received were pretty much the same.  They are both very bright.  I use the larger one for a great amount of light and the smaller one for a little more light."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,I love mixing bowls with this set and the combo is very easy to use. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The bowls are great to take with me to work and I love the color. I am very pleased with the quality of the bowls. The bowls are a bit smaller than I expected and I would not be able to fit a full bowl into a bowl. I will probably purchase another set if I need one.I received this item for free in exchange for my honest review.
